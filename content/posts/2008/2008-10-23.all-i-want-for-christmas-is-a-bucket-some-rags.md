<p>Damien spent a great deal of time last weekend with this bucket filled with cloths that he took from my dishcloth/towel drawer.  He would empty it out in various places, and then pick them up one at a time and put them back in.  And once they were all in, he would cram them down nice &amp; tight so he could carry them to the next location and do it all over again.  It kept him entertained for several hours (or maybe just minutes) at a time!</p>

<p>We also spent some time out in the leaves last week and got some pretty good pictures.</p>

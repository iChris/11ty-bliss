<p>Its been a month since we've started solids with Damien, and he seems to be doing quite well with it.</p>

<p>He started with some rice cereal (but then I had a lick of that and realized it tasted like paste, so I thought we'd try something else).  He moved onto oatmeal cereal quite easily, and loves it.</p>

<p>Now we've tried avocados, squash, pears, sweet potatos, peaches, and bananas.</p>

<p>He seems to like the sweet potatoes &amp; bananas best, but opens his mouth wide for almost everything these days, so its not hard to get the spoon in with something new.  Next we'll try carrots!</p>

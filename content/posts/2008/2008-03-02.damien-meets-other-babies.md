title: "Damien Meets Other Babies"

<p>We had a good get together with a bunch of old friends on Saturday - friends who now have babies of their own.  It was good to connect and see how much everyone's baby had grown up.</p>

<p>One possible side effect of getting together is that now Damien is sick.  He's gotten a bit of a fever and just not himself today.  Hopefully none of the other babies got sick as well!</p>

<p>We're still around, and still taking lots of pictures of Damien.  We kind of forgot about this site for awhile, so here's a bunch of new pictures to get us caught up.  :)</p>
<p>Damien has started crawling up onto things - chairs, stairs and now into his wagon:</p>

<p>It makes it harder to just leave him in a room to play now as he can get into so much more stuff as he figures out how to climb up higher.</p>
<p>He's still not walking on his own - though he'll gladly hold your hand and walk along with you.  He <em>loves</em> to push around his wagon and walk around the house with it:</p>

<p>Tried out <a href="https://www.mennoboy.com/chris/archives/2005/01/very_cool_set_o.html">this technique</a> for pictures.<br />
It's easy to do an ok job of it (this took me maybe five minutes including taking the pictures and combining them in PS) but you'd have to do more planning/have a better camera/spend more time in PS to get it as good as the originals.  Either way, it's still a neat idea for taking pictures.</p>

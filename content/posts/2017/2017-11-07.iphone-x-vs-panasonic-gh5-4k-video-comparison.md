title: "iPhone X vs Panasonic GH5 in 4k Video Comparison"
---
<p>This is a great comparison video because they're not out to prove the iPhone X is better than the Panasonic GH5 - they state they use both in their own productions - but just show the footage and let you see for yourself. <a href="https://www.iphoneincanada.ca/news/4k-video-iphone-x-vs-panasonic-gh5/">Video via iPhoneinCanada.ca</a>:</p>

<p>It's an interesting time for videographers where a <a href="https://www.apple.com/ca/shop/buy-iphone/iphone-x/5.8-inch-display-256gb-space-grey#00,11,21">$1,529CDN</a> phone can compete with a <a href="https://amzn.to/2ygr044">$3,290CDN</a> camera. The portability of an iPhone X alone makes it a very compelling choice vs all the gear of a traditional video camera rig.</p>
<p>I've been researching camera options for an upcoming project and the budget definitely doesn't allow for GH5 level gear - but $1,500 certainly would be in the ball park. This comparison video makes it compelling to just pick up an unlocked iPhone X.</p>
<p>Plus when they compare making phone calls, checking Twitter, or sending an email - I bet the iPhone X wipes the floor with the GH5. ;)</p>

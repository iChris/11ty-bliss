<p><a href="https://www.sportsnet.ca/hockey/nhl/gord-downie-canadas-humble-genius/">Gord Downie was Canada’s humble genius</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  "Two words," Gord was saying quietly to himself. "I only have to remember two words — First Nations." Gord’s rule about a fresh performance, in this, his final performance, was based on a fresh start, a new narrative for Canada. This was not about sympathy, it was about rights. Gord’s art. He was using his final show to tell us how to free ourselves from our attitudes. To change policies conceptually and financially. None of us should forget those two words. Just as we will never forget the show.

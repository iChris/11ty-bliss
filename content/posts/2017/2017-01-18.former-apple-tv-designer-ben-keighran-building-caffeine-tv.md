title: "Former Apple TV Designer Ben Keighran is Building Caffeine.tv"
---
<p>A year ago <a href="https://twitter.com/benkeighran">Ben Keighran</a> <a href="https://www.recode.net/2016/1/19/11588930/apple-tv-designer-ben-keighran-is-leaving">quit at Apple</a>, where he was in the Apple TV division working on the latest version of the Apple TV.</p>
<p>Now he's the co-founder and leader of <a href="https://www.caffeine.tv">Caffeine</a>, a streaming service that aims to compete with <a href="https://www.twitch.tv">Twitch</a> and <a href="https://gaming.youtube.com">YouTube Gaming</a> for the hearts and eyeballs of gaming nerds everywhere.</p>
<p>Caffeine is currently in beta - you can set up an account, <a href="https://www.caffeine.tv/iChris">like mine</a>, for free via Twitter but you can't actually stream anything until you're approved by Caffeine. Which I'm not.</p>
<p>No word on how exactly they're implementing the streaming but due to the fact that using the site currently requires Chrome or Firefox, I'm guessing they're using a browser based method of capturing gameplay as opposed to using downloaded software like <a href="https://obsproject.com">OBS</a> or <a href="https://www.gameshow.net">Gameshow</a>.</p>
<p>It'll be a tough uphill fight against the big players - Twitch is owned by Amazon and YouTube is an Alphabet/Google property - but internet nerds love an underdog story and an opportunity to be an early adopter on a new platform is hard to resist.</p>
<p>Why be one of millions on YouTube when you can be in the top 10 on Twitch or Caffeine?</p>

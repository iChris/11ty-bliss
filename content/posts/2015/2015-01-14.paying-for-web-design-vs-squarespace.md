title: "Paying for Web Design vs Squarespace"
---
<p>Something about the way John Gruber &amp; Marco Arment mocked paying money for web design during a Squarespace ad on The Talk Show seemed off. You can <a href="https://pca.st/yRf5" target="_blank">listen here at the 1:14 mark</a>.</p>
<p>(<strong>Edit</strong>: I should add that the <a href="https://daringfireball.net/thetalkshow/2015/01/12/ep-107">rest of the episode</a> is a great discussion of the struggles Apple is facing with keeping up software support on the Mac and iOS.)</p>
<p>Iâ€™m not at all worried about my business or profession. It just sounded odd coming from two very creative people. People I generally respect. To hear your profession and business mocked so soundly hit a bit of a nerve I guess.</p>
<p>Replace web design with iOS app design and would it be the same giggle? I realize neither John nor Marco make their money by developing iOS apps for clients. And I'm sure they're smart enough to recognize the value of having a professional involved in creating a website in some (most?) situations.</p>
<p>Maybe the web design profession has gotten smeared with a similar brush as the SEO world where a bunch of bad apples who make a quick buck off uploading a theme to WordPress, copying and pasting in a bit of content, and then are never heard from again.</p>
<p>For the record, I have no problem recommending <a href="https://www.squarespace.com/" target="_blank">Squarespace</a> to potential clients when it doesn't make sense for them to hire me. It's an amazing platform that's really powerful, really well designed and works great right out of the box.</p>
<p>I just think you could do a better sponsor read that didn't involve mocking something. Talk about the benefits and positives of a product or service.</p>
<p>But then what do I know from sponsor reads? I'm certainly not charging <a href="https://standard.fm">$4k/episode for sponsorships</a>.</p>

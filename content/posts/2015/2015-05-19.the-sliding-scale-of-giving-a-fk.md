<blockquote><p>Interestingly, it turns out that many, many of the decisions I’m a part of day-to-day and week-to-week rate pretty low on the scale. It’s rare that I find myself beyond a five, which is probably right. Someone said to me once: if everything is an emergency, then nothing is. Similarly, if I’m a ten-out-of-ten on every single decision I’m ever a part of, how can anyone know or trust me when I say something’s very important to me? Having an internal barometer for what’s important and what’s less critical is incredibly useful for helping others trust your responses to ideas and proposals.</p></blockquote>

title: "Show Me Your Transmission"

<p>Kyle and Kenny Roderick were nice enough to invite me on their show <a href="https://goodstuff.fm/transmission">Transmission</a> for episode #127:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Today on Transmission: Come here Max - we're answering your questions today, I want my lightbulbs to act as one, Someone spent Dr-Evil-level money in NY, Nerf guns are cool again, The plumber who became self-aware, GARCO is becoming more like us, We play some sort of song challenge, and more.
</p></blockquote>
<p>It took all my effort to not just sit and giggle the whole time. I think I did ok.</p>

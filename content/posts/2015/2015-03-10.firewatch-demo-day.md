<p>Panic, maker of amazing software like Transmit and Coda, are also publishing a beautiful new game called Firewatch:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  In Firewatch, you play as a man named Henry who has retreated from his messy life to work as a fire lookout in the Wyoming wilderness. Perched high atop a mountain, it’s your job to look for smoke and keep the wilderness safe. Your supervisor, a woman named Delilah, is available to you at all times over a small, handheld radio — and is your only contact with the world you’ve left behind.

<p><a href="https://ca.ign.com/articles/2015/03/02/firewatch-17-minutes-of-new-gameplay-ign-first">Check out the first 17 minutes of gameplay on IGN</a> to get a taste for it - but it reminds me of playing Police Quest/King's Quest games from Sierra back in the day, only with modern graphics and mechanics.</p>
<p>On <a href="https://www.panic.com/blog/firewatch-demo-day-at-gdc/">Panic's blog</a> they show the incredible detail they went to in order to promote the game at the recent Game Developers Conference.</p>
<p>Firewatch is slated to be released in late 2015 for Mac/PC.</p>

<p>(Swear words ahead)</p>
<p>Sites like <a href="https://patreon.com/ichris">Patreon</a> are, in my opinion, the way forward.</p>
<p>Don't just leech! Give back to the artists, video makers, podcasters, writers, painters, etc. that you love, enjoy and appreciate. They are not getting rich off of the likes, views, reblogs and favs you bestow upon them and if you want them to be around to keep making the stuff you enjoy watching, listening, looking at or whatever they need your help.</p>

<blockquote><p><span style="-webkit-text-size-adjust: auto; background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">I heard someone once say there comes a day when they tell us all that we can’t play anymore. We’re not good enough. Surplus to requirements. Too slow, maybe. When you’re a teenager with outsized dreams and a growing obsession, and someone tells you this ain’t gonna last forever, it’s scary. I never forgot it.</span></p></blockquote>

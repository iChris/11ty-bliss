title: "Layout from Instagram"
---
<p>From <a href="https://blog.instagram.com/post/114416360957/layout-from-instagram">the Instagram blog</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Today weâ€™re announcing Layout from Instagram, a new app that lets you easily combine<br />
  multiple photos into a single image.
</p></blockquote>
<p>The app I was occasionally using for this purpose was last updated for iOS 6 so it's good timing for me.</p>
<p>It makes sense to not put this inside the existing Instagram app - people are searching for a layout/photo arranging app anyway. Might as try and keep them inside the Instagram ecosystem rather than using a 3rd party app and hope they remember to post back to Instagram.</p>
<p>As with <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/ca/app/hyperlapse-from-instagram/id740146917?mt=8&amp;uo=4&amp;at=10l4Ki">Hyperlapse</a>, Layout by Instagram is <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/layout-from-instagram/id967351793">available for iOS first in the App Store</a>, apparently available on Android in the coming months.</p>

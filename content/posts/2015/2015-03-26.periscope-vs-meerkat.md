title: "Periscope vs Meerkat"
---
<p>Meerkat is an app, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/ca/app/meerkat-tweet-live-video/id954105918?mt=8&amp;uo=4&amp;at=10l4Ki">currently only for iOS</a>, that allows you to tap a button and start streaming live video out to the world from your iPhone.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.periscope.tv">Periscope</a> is an app that basically does the same thing and <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/id972909677?mt=8&amp;uo=4&amp;at=10l4Ki">was just released</a>, also for iOS only so far. Twitter bought the app before it was even released.</p>
<p>The battle for the live stream has begun.</p>

<blockquote><p>
  Fire up the app, launch the camera, and the app tweets out a message (if you want it to) that you have gone live. Simultaneously, a notification fires off — with that little look-at-me whistle — to everyone following you on Periscope. As they join in, they can comment on what you’re doing. And because it has super-low lag time — or latency, to use the term of art — people watching can comment on your actions more or less as they happen. It means that people watching the video can change the course of what’s happening.

<p>I just tried it out for this post and got 10 random people, none of whom follow me on Twitter to my knowledge, watching me do basically nothing.</p>
<p>The app allows you to save your video locally afterwards - because I know I'll want to re-watch that amazing footage over and over - as well as store it on the app in the cloud for people to be equally as excited by the amazing video you shot.</p>
<p>Ultimately I think the live video streaming idea will adopted by other companies - Facebook no doubt is already working on something - and it'll become as normal to live stream your lunch as it is right now to put a picture on Instagram.</p>

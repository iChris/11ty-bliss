<p>Vimeo <a href="https://vimeo.com/blog/post:747">acquired and then updated Cameo for iOS</a>. You can <a href="https://geo.itunes.apple.com/ca/app/cameo-video-editor-movie-maker/id988821661?mt=8&amp;uo=6&amp;at=10l4Ki">download it for free in the App Store</a>.</p>

<p>From the demo video it looks like Cameo has an interesting take on editing clips. Zooming in on a clip and editing it directly looks much easier, particularly on a iPhone-sized screen.</p>
<p>9 times out of 10, I just do quick edits on movies in the built-in Photos app and then occasionally fire up <a href="https://geo.itunes.apple.com/ca/app/imovie/id377298193?mt=8&amp;uo=6&amp;at=10l4Ki">iMovie</a> for something with multiple clips. I usually forgot to use other apps to be honest. But Cameo looks like a good option to keep handy.</p>

<p>Editing this video was pretty quick and easy with Cameo. My main frustration with the app is the inability to add/edit still photos to your projects like you can with other video editing apps like iMovie.</p>

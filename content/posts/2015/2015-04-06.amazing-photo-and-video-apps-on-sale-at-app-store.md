title: "Amazing Photo and Video Apps on Sale at App Store"
---
<p>Apple's running a "everything is at least 50% off" promotion for photo and video apps for both iOS and the Mac App Store. I'm not a big user of iOS apps for photography beyond the usual suspects - Apple's Camera and Photos app, Instagram and Flickr occasionally - the better deals are on the Mac apps:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/pixelmator/id407963104?mt=12&uo=4&at=10l4Ki" target="itunes_store">Pixelmator</a> is a great Photoshop alternative at a fraction of the price.</li>
<li><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/ca/app/flare-2/id924691732?mt=12&uo=4&at=10l4Ki" target="itunes_store">Flare 2</a> and <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/ca/app/analog/id418343177?mt=12&uo=4&at=10l4Ki" target="itunes_store">Analog</a> are kind of like Instagram filters for your Mac.</li>
<li><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/ca/app/screenflow-5/id917790450?mt=12&uo=4&at=10l4Ki" target="itunes_store">ScreenFlow 5</a> is the best deal. A great app for editing video. It's designed primarily for recording your Mac's display to demo software but it works great as a video editor if <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/ca/app/imovie/id408981434?mt=12&uo=4&at=10l4Ki" target="itunes_store">iMovie</a> isn't your cup of tea.</li>
</ul>

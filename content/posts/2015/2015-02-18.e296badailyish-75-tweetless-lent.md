title: "â–ºDaily(ish) 75: Tweetless Lent"
---
<p>I've decided to give up Twitter for lent. Normally I'd just tweet stuff like this out but... I recorded an episode of Daily(ish) to explain it a bit, so if you're curious you can <a href="https://goodstuff.fm/dailyish/75">listen here</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Clarification on what I meant by giving up Twitter for Lent in yesterday&#39;s episode. And arguments about podcast listening speed.
</p></blockquote>
<p>As I said in the episode, I'd like to think that I'll <a href="https://goodstuff.fm/dailyish">podcast more</a> and spend the time I would've spent on Twitter in deep, contemplative thought about life and what it all means - but I know it'll be just as easy to fill that void with other distractions if I'm not careful.</p>
<p>Are you giving up anything for lent? Or maybe just stopping something for a period of time to evaluate what effect it has on you?</p>

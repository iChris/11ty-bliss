title: "Build and Launch with Justin Jackson"
---
<p>Speaking of <a href="https://chrisenns.com/2015/01/tools-gear-and-hardware-for-a-first-time-podcaster/">how to get started podcasting</a>, <a href="https://www.twitter.com/mijustin">Justin Jackson</a> is 5 episodes in to his new podcast called <a href="https://buildandlaunch.net">Build and Launch</a> - his plan is to launch a new mini-product/service each week in February - but as part of his launch week for the podcast he's spent the first 5 episodes talking about how he's recording his podcast:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://buildandlaunch.net/1/">EP1: Donâ€™t make stuff for hippies</a></li>
<li><a href="https://buildandlaunch.net/2/">EP2: A ton of coffee and feeling good</a></li>
<li><a href="https://buildandlaunch.net/3/">EP3: Podcasting gear starter kit</a></li>
<li><a href="https://buildandlaunch.net/4/">EP4: How do you say creeper in French?</a></li>
<li><a href="https://buildandlaunch.net/5/">EP5: Re-launch my beard</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Justin's been a frequent guest on <a href="https://goodstuff.fm">Goodstuff</a> shows and is always entertaining. He's done a great job of giving advice on setting up a podcast - I particularly dig his use of his family to give perspective on what he's trying to do. Something I'll have to try and incorporate more on <a href="https://goodstuff.fm/dailyish/">Daily(ish)</a> if my family is willing.</p>

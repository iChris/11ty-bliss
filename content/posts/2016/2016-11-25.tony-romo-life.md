title: "Tony Romo on Life"
---
<p>Tony Romo is a quarterback for the Dallas Cowboys and he recently <a href="https://www.espn.com/blog/dallas-cowboys/post/_/id/4755730/full-transcript-of-tony-romos-statement">released this statement</a> on how he's processing being seriously injured in the later stages of his career and having to watch his replacement lead the team he was supposed to lead this year.</p>
<p>He ends with this which is a great reminder of how so many issues in life come down to how you handle it as opposed to trying to change someone else:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  I feel like we all have two battles or two enemies going on. One with the man across from you. The second is with the man inside of you. I think once you control the one inside of you, the one across from you really doesn't matter.
</p></blockquote>

<p>Well if anything was going to bring me out of blogging retirement, it would have to be more Star Wars.</p>
<p>I hadn't read or heard much about Rogue One and just assumed, because of <a href="https://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Star_Wars:_Clone_Wars">Star Wars: Clone Wars</a> and <a href="https://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Star_Wars_Rebels">Star Wars: Rebels</a> that Rogue One would also be a cartoon series.</p>
<p>So I was really pumped to find out that (a) it's live action, and (b) it's a full blown movie set in the Star Wars universe.</p>
<blockquote><p>
  ...the film will revolve around a rogue band of resistance fighters who unite for a daring mission to steal the Death Star plans and bring new hope to the galaxy.

<p>Can't wait for December 16th, 2016.</p>

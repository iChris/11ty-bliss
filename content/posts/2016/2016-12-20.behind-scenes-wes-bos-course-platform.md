title: "Behind the Scenes on Wes Bos' Course Platform"

<p>I'm a sucker for behind the scenes of almost anything except how hot dogs are made.</p>
<p>Wes Bos <a href="https://wesbos.com/courses/">puts out awesome training courses</a> for really nerdy web stuff that even I don't understand most of. And of course for someone who knows as much as he does about web dev/code magic, he doesn't just use an existing app to run the store to sell/giveaway his courses.</p>

title: "Mac Streaming to Twitch via OBS Issues"
---
<p>I've been trying to figure out how to stream video/audio to Twitch or YouTube using a piece of software called <a href="https://obsproject.com">OBS</a> - short for Open Broadcaster Software. It's a super powerful piece of software that's absolutely free to use. Pretty incredible. But most of the users seem to be Windows based and so there isn't as much documentation/tutorials on the Mac side.</p>
<p>What I'm trying to accomplish is this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Send video and audio of a game (Minecraft) to Twitch.</li>
<li>Send video from my Logitech C920 webcam to Twitch.</li>
<li>Send audio from my Heil PR40 mic attached to a Onyx 1620i mixer to Twitch.</li>
<li>Send audio from a <a href="https://discordapp.com">Discord</a> or Skype call with a friend to Twitch.</li>
</ul>
<p>All at the same time.</p>
<p>If you check out my <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/ichrisplaysgames/profile">Twitch channel</a>, you should be able to see a few videos there showing what I mean. I seem to have gotten the first 3 items working ok - it's just when I add in an audio call with someone that it breaks down. The audio call works fine and I can hear them, they can hear me. I just can't get their audio to be piped through to OBS and out to Twitch/YouTube.</p>

<h2>Links to Software I've Tried</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://support.shinywhitebox.com/hc/en-us/articles/204161459-Installing-iShowU-Audio-Capture">iShow U Audio Capture</a> - free and seems to work except for the last issue.</li>
<li><a href="https://staticz.com">Sound Siphon</a> - this seems to work ok except it doesn't seem to quite work.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.rogueamoeba.com/loopback/">Loopback by Rogue Amoeba</a> - They were very helpful in attempting to figure out some of my issues. It didn't seem to help and for $75USD (currently over $100CAD), it seemed unlikely to be helpful in my situation.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.rogueamoeba.com/audiohijack/">Audio Hijack by Rogue Amoeba</a> - is what I might try next if I can't figure out a way to get iShowU Audio Capture to play nicely with everything else. Audio Hijack would also give me the benefit of being able to record my audio in case I wanted to do an audio podcast with whatever I'm streaming.</li>
<li><a href="https://telestream.net/wirecast/overview.htm?__c=1">Wirecast</a> would likely work and probably take care of it all for me. But it's $495USD (almost $700CAD) and this is a hobby for fun. [footnote]If anyone at Wirecast wants to talk sponsorship ideas, I'm all ears! :)[/footnote]</li>
</ul>
<p>Hopefully someone can chime in in the comments below with some suggestions. Or let me know if you have questions about using OBS, Audio Hijack, or any other streaming on a Mac issues. I might not get my issue solved but at least we can help each other figure this stuff out.</p>

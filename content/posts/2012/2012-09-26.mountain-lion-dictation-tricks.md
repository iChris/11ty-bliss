<p>Once you've turned it on, you can decide what shortcut key to use to enable Dictation.</p>
<h3>Sample dictation</h3>
<p>As you can see from my tests below, it's not great. It even conveniently "missed" the isn't in the first sample.</p>
<blockquote><p>
  The dictation is great but it would work in a pinch.</p>
<p>  I use dictation to write this part of the post</p>
<p>  As you can see it forgot the D and Mr. Cents and I can say. Again.</p>
<p>  Attempting to say. This while you're dictating doesn't work very well because it will put it. Very sad.

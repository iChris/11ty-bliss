<p>Dan Frakes at Macworld <a href="https://www.macworld.com/article/1167629/get_your_mac_ready_for_mountain_lion.html">helps you get your Mac ready</a> for the forthcoming Mountain Lion release, slated for sometime in July:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  As with Lion (OS X 10.7) last year, Apple is advertising Mountain Lion as dead-simple to install. But as with every major upgrade to OS X, there are a few things you can do before Mountain Lion is released to ensure that your Mac is ready for the new release.

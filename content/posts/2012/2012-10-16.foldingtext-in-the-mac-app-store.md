title: "FoldingText in the Mac App Store"

<p>An app that I <a href="https://chrisenns.com/2012/10/foldingtext/">posted about</a> just over a week ago is now out of beta and<br />
in the Mac App Store - <a href="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?grid=9646&id=6PFrOqNV4B8&offerid=162397&type=3&subid=0&tmpid=3664&RD_PARM1=https%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fca%252Fapp%252Ffoldingtext%252Fid540003654%253Fmt%253D12%2526uo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30" target="itunes_store">FoldingText is available for $14.99</a>. It's currently at a 40% off launch sale<sup id="fnref-20872:1"><a href="#fn-20872:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Like I said in my original post, it won't be for everyone but it could hit the sweet spot for a few in the note taking, to do list/GTD area.</p>
<p>Even at it's sale price of $14.99 it's a bit too much for what I can currently see myself using it for.</p>

My math isn't good enough to figure out what 100% would be though I suspect it's somewhere near $32.99, give or take a dollar.&#160;<a href="#fnref-20872:1" rev="footnote">&#8617;</a>

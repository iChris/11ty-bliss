<p>I first posted about The Civil Wars <a href="https://chrisenns.com/2012/02/the-civil-wars-barton-hollow/">back in February</a> after their little cameo on the Grammy awards. Today they were on <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/q/">Q</a>, a Canadian radio talk show:</p>

<p>If you didn't pick it up back in February, I'd still recommend <a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/stat?id=6PFrOqNV4B8&offerid=146261&type=3&subid=0&tmpid=1826&RD_PARM1=http%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fca%252Falbum%252Fbarton-hollow%252Fid443642774%253Fuo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30" target="itunes_store">grabbing a copy of Barton Hollow, their debut album, off iTunes</a> or wherever you buy music. At $7.99CDN it's a steal.</p>
<p>If you're too cheap to buy the whole album, at least pick up <a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/stat?id=6PFrOqNV4B8&offerid=146261&type=3&subid=0&tmpid=1826&RD_PARM1=http%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fca%252Falbum%252Fbarton-hollow%252Fid443642774%253Fi%253D443642784%2526uo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30" target="itunes_store">Barton Hollow for $0.99</a>. Your ears will thank you.</p>

<p>Looks interesting. Not a huge surprise as apparently podcasts were removed from the Music app in iOS 6.</p>
<p>Though according to <a href="https://twitter.com/donmcallister/status/217676236078579713">this tweet</a>, RSS support is non-existent which means it's only good for podcasts listed in the iTunes Podcast directory. Shouldn't be a problem since all a podcast has to do is submit their RSS feed to Apple for inclusion - but some podcasts may not be in there for a variety of reasons.</p>

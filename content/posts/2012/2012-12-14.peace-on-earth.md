<p><em>Lyrics from U2's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J74E6yanaO8">Peace on Earth</a></em></p>
<p>Heaven on Earth<br />
We need it now<br />
I'm sick of all of this<br />
Hanging around<br />
Sick of sorrow<br />
Sick of pain<br />
Sick of hearing again and again<br />
That there's gonna be<br />
Peace on Earth</p>
<p>Jesus could you take the time<br />
To throw a drowning man a line<br />
Peace on Earth<br />
Tell the ones who hear no sound<br />
Whose sons are living in the ground<br />
Peace on Earth<br />
No whos or whys<br />
No-one cries like a mother cries<br />
For peace on Earth<br />
She never got to say goodbye<br />
To see the color in his eyes<br />
Now he's in the dirt<br />
That's peace on Earth</p>
<p>They're reading names out over the radio<br />
All the folks the rest of us won't get to know<br />
Sean and Julia, Gareth, Anne and Breda<br />
Their lives are bigger, than any big idea</p>
<p>Jesus this song you wrote<br />
The words are sticking in my throat<br />
Peace on Earth<br />
Hear it every Christmas time<br />
But hope and history won't rhyme<br />
So what's it worth?<br />
This peace on Earth</p>

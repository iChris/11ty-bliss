<p><a href="https://www.marco.org/2012/07/02/thunderbolt-gigabit-adapter">Read the review for the details</a> but chances are you'll <a href="https://store.apple.com/ca/product/MD463">want one for $29</a> if you transfer large files on a non-ethernet equipped Mac.</p>
<p>I can't remember if I've ever used the <a href="https://store.apple.com/ca/product/MC704ZM/A">USB to Ethernet adapter</a> I picked up when I bought my MacBook Air so I won't be rushing out to grab one.</p>
<p>But if I was moving around more video files, it'd be the first thing I'd pick up.</p>

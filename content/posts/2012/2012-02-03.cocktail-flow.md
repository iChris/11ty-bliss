<p>Cocktail Flow (<a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/stat?id=6PFrOqNV4B8&offerid=146261&type=3&subid=0&tmpid=1826&RD_PARM1=http%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fca%252Fapp%252Fcocktail-flow%252Fid486811622%253Fmt%253D8%2526uo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30" target="itunes_store">iTunes App Store link (free)</a>) is a drink recipe app<sup id="fnref-20054:1"><a href="#fn-20054:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> that allows you to browse, find and discover cocktails.</p>
<p>It's a beautifully designed app with plenty of nifty little animations and visual treats to go along with the recipes.</p>
<p>[gallery link="file"]</p>
<p>The up sell for them is by selling add-on theme packs of recipes. For example, they've got a Super Bowl theme pack with drinks named "The Bloody Halfback", "Safety Kick", and "Brady Bomb" - but there's plenty of free recipes included.</p>
<p>A nice feature is the ability to specify what drinks you have in your cabinet (<em>i.e. Irish Whiskey, Scotch, White Rum, Amaretto and Irish Cream</em><sup id="fnref-20054:2"><a href="#fn-20054:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>) and then it can tell you what drinks you can make from that mix (<em>Amaretto Sour, Blow Job<sup id="fnref-20054:3"><a href="#fn-20054:3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup> or a Godfather if you're curious.</em>)</p>
<p>Or choose the drinks you want to be able to make and it will spit out a shopping list, along with suggested costs.</p>
<p>One minor gripe is that there's no ability to select Canadian currency as an option - though I suspect the USD is close enough for estimating your bill.</p>
<p>All in all, a very good app particularly when you consider it's free.</p>

<p>I can't stand most reality TV shows but Survivor and The Amazing Race are the two that my wife and I enjoy watching. <sup id="fnref-20758:1"><a href="#fn-20758:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>
<p>I don't like it when they bring on celebrities because it starts to feel like a ratings grab - except that typically the celebrities they bring on are huge fans of Survivor and want to be on the show as badly as anyone else.</p>
<p>This edition's famous players include a former Los Angeles Dodgers baseball player, <a href="https://www.cbs.com/shows/survivor/cast/159999/">Jeff Kent</a>, and <a href="https://www.cbs.com/shows/survivor/cast/160003/">Lisa Whelchel</a> who was an actress on the 80s TV show <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0078610/">Facts of Life</a>. The ironic thing is that most of the other contestants are probably too young to even know or care who a 80s TV star is anyway.</p>

Yes I know you watched the first season and haven't watched it since. And yet you're still an expert on how bad a show it is. Tell me more about things you know so much about yet haven't actually watched or experienced in 10 years, I love it.&#160;<a href="#fnref-20758:1" rev="footnote">&#8617;</a>

title: "Camera+ Updated with iCloud Support"
---
<p>In addition to iOS6 and iPhone 5 support, they've added iCloud syncing of your light-table - so any photos you haven't saved out to the iOS Camera Roll will be synced across iCloud to other devices.</p>
<p>They've also released an iPad version which looks great for editing photos on a bigger screen which when combined with iCloud support would make for a sweet mobile photography workflow. One person shooting photos on the iPhone 5 while an editor edits them on an iPad.</p>
<p>Both versions of Camera+ are priced at $0.99 right now: <a href="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?grid=9646&id=6PFrOqNV4B8&offerid=162397&type=3&subid=0&tmpid=3664&RD_PARM1=http%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fca%252Fapp%252Fcamera%252B%252Fid329670577%253Fmt%253D8%2526uo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30" target="itunes_store">Camera+ for iPhone</a> or <a href="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?grid=9646&id=6PFrOqNV4B8&offerid=162397&type=3&subid=0&tmpid=3664&RD_PARM1=http%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fca%252Fapp%252Fcamera%252B-for-ipad%252Fid550902799%253Fmt%253D8%2526uo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30" target="itunes_store">Camera+ for iPad</a>.</p>

<p>Easily the best ski video I've ever seen<sup id="fnref-19973:1"><a href="#fn-19973:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> and what I saw was only a small part of it.</p>
<p>We saw the video below at the Banff Mountain Film Festival last night when it came through town. Incredible cinematography, music and editing. Viewing it on a computer screen doesn't really do it justice<sup id="fnref-19973:2"><a href="#fn-19973:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> as compared to watching it on the huge screen at TCU Place. Mark it to watch later on your Apple TV.</p>

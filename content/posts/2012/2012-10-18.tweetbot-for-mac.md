<p>I haven't decided if I'm going to pick up a copy yet. I think they're fully justified in charging $19.99 for an awesome looking app that I'd use everyday to access a service that has provided a good portion of my <a href="https://www.lemonproductions.ca">business clients</a>. I just am unsure about where Twitter is headed as a company and if my money would be better spent on the coming launch of <a href="https://tapbots.com/software/netbot/mac">Netbot for Mac</a>[1].</p>

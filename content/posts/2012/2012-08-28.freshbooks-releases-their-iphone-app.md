title: "FreshBooks Releases Their iPhone App"

<p>Some might say <em>finally</em> but I won't stoop to that. I'm just happy that they have the app out. I'll have to update my <a href="https://chrisenns.com/recommends/freshbooks/">FreshBooks review</a> once I've had a chance to use the app, but on first glance it looks great.</p>
<p>The ability to take a photo of a receipt for expense tracking will save me having to send those kinds of documents through <a href="https://evernote.com">Evernote</a> - though having a back up there might not hurt if the tax folks came calling.</p>

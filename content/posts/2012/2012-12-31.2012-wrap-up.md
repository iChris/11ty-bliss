title: "2012 Wrap Up"
---
<p>This past year I've had a bit of a renewed focus on posting my thoughts on this blog. I appreciate those of you who visit and enjoy by what I decide to post and link to.</p>
<p>I thought I'd post a bit of a recap with links to some of my favourite things I've posted over the past year.</p>
<h3>The Podcast</h3>
<p>I relaunched the <a href="https://chrisenns.com/the-podcast/">Too Lazy to Blog podcast</a> as a sort of audio commentary for this blog. It has been reasonably well received/downloaded and I’ve had fun doing it so I think I’ll continue it in 2013. Having a weekly random guest keeps it interesting and challenging.</p>
<p>On to the Year in Review...</p>

<p>So that's the year on my blog. I'd hoped to have written more original material but at the same time it's very much a hobby site for me to post things I find interesting so I'm not too disappointed.</p>
<p>I'm not a huge fan of New Year's Resolutions but I do enjoy using events that mark the passing of time to evaluate what I'm doing and why. But that's for another post to come. Hopefully in 2013.</p>
<p>Thanks again for reading, visiting, sharing, linking and liking here on Faraway, So Close. I appreciate all the silent lurkers who pop in from time to time and really enjoy the few that decide to leave a comment or question every now and then.</p>

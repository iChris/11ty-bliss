<p>Despite the outcry of bloggers and tech nerds, Apple will shockingly continue to sell the iPad mini at whatever price it deems necessary to turn a profit and sell a whole bunch.</p>
<p>Philip Schiller, Senior VP of Worldwide Marketing at Apple, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/10/23/us-apple-schiller-idUSBRE89M1IN20121023">defended their pricing</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  "The iPad is far and away the most successful product in its category. The most affordable product we've made so far was $399 and people were choosing that over those devices. And now you can get a device that's even more affordable at $329 in this great new form, and I think a lot of customers are going to be very excited about that."
</p></blockquote>
<p>Translation: Cheaper tablets from our competitors are cheap. We sold 100 million iPads when the least expensive model was $399. We think people will happily pay $70 less to continue buying iPads.</p>

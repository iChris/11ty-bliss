title: "Easy Screen Sharing"
---
<p>If you've ever done any amount of trouble shooting over the phone, you know what a great invention the ability to share your screen - or have someone else share their screen with you.</p>
<p>Screen sharing is built into <a href="https://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?path=iChat/4.0/en/11883.html">iChat</a> (or iMessage beta), Google Chat (<a href="https://lifehacker.com/5842191/google%252B-hangouts-adds-screen-sharing-google-docs-collaboration-and-more">in Google+ Hangouts at least</a> and <a href="https://support.skype.com/en-us/faq/FA10022/How-do-I-share-my-screen-in-Skype-for-Mac-OS-X">Skype</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.screenleap.com/">Screenleap</a> is a web site/app that allows you to share your screen with anyone. Nothing to download and nothing to install other then a Java applet. Share it with one person or share it with a whole bunch of people if you're wanting to demo something to your staff or clients.</p>
<p>And it's free. So enjoy it while it's around because it'll probably be gone and/or sold off to a bigger company which will start charging for it.</p>

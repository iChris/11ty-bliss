<p>First off, <a href="https://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/09/13/daily-report-an-iphone-tweak-that-could-cost-you/">great minds think alike and all that</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  What does Apple do when it deems a technology past its expiration date? They abandon it. What do tech writers do when Apple abandons these outdated but ubiquitous technologies? They pitch fits. Happened with the floppy drive. Happened when the original iMac went USB-only. Happened with optical drives. Happens every few years with display adaptors.
</p></blockquote>
<p>And the event itself:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  And what shows they were. When Schiller unveiled the iPhone 5, it rose from the stage floor on a smoothly-rising and rotating pedestal, pinpoint spotlights hitting the phone and only the phone. The rotation of the iPhone atop the pedestal was in perfect sync with the rotation of the iPhone projected on the big screen at the back of the stage. Thereâ€™s no store where you buy such pedestals; Apple designed and engineered it specifically for this event. It was on stage for about a minute.

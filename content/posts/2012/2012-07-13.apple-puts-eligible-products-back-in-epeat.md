title: "Apple Puts Eligible Products Back in EPEAT"
---
<p>An interesting change of plans from a company that rarely bows to public pressure through a <a href="https://www.apple.com/environment/letter-to-customers/">letter from outgoing hardware chief Bob Mansfield</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Weâ€™ve recently heard from many loyal Apple customers who were disappointed to learn that we had removed our products from the EPEAT rating system. I recognize that this was a mistake. Starting today, all eligible Apple products are back on EPEAT.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Key words being eligible products.</p>

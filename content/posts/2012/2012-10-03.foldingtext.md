title: FoldingText

<p>Yet another text editor. Billed as "Plain text productivity for geeks", <a href="https://www.foldingtext.com">FoldingText</a> is in beta but it brings some neat tricks to the relatively simple text editor genre of apps.</p>
<p>Click on the 'Watch Movie' link at the bottom of <a href="https://www.foldingtext.com">the FoldingText site</a> - I'm unable to directly link to it - to see how it works as well as features that are coming. <del datetime="2012-10-03T20:39:11+00:00">The to do list and timer functionality that are coming soon look particularly neat. </del> My mistake - these are in there I just didn't <a href="https://support.foldingtext.com/kb/frequently-asked-questions/how-to-create-pomodoro-worksheet-in-foldingtext">read the instructions properly</a>.</p>
<p>It won't be for everyone but for the right type of Mac user, FoldingText could be a great simple, powerful tool.</p>

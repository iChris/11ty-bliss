title: "New iMacs Available for Order"
---
<p>Apple's redesigned <a href="https://www.apple.com/ca/imac/">21.5" and 27" iMac is now available for order</a>. I got to order one, albeit vicariously, for a <a href="https://lemonproductions.ca">client</a> with the new <a href="https://www.apple.com/ca/imac/performance/">Fusion drive</a> which will be interesting to see how it performs.</p>
<p>Which got me to thinking - if I was blessed with an anonymous donation for the <a href="https://ssktn.com">SSKTN studio</a>, what would I upgrade the mid-2008 iMac I use for recording podcasts and producing video to, and how much would it cost?</p>
<h3>Current Dream Power-horse Mac</h3>
<ul>
<li>27" Display</li>
<li>3.4GHz Quad-core Intel Core i7, Turbo Boost up to 3.9GHz</li>
<li>16GB 1600MHz DDR3 SDRAM - 2X8GB</li>
<li>1TB Fusion Drive</li>
<li>NVIDIA GeForce GTX 680MX 2GB GDDR5</li>
<li>Apple Magic Mouse + Magic Trackpad</li>
</ul>
<p>The $200 upgrade to the Core i7 would help when bouncing a recording out of Logic to an MP3 for a podcast or exporting a video edited in <a href="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?grid=9646&id=6PFrOqNV4B8&offerid=162397&type=3&subid=0&tmpid=3664&RD_PARM1=https%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fca%252Fapp%252Fscreenflow-4%252Fid573279886%253Fmt%253D12%2526uo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30" target="itunes_store">ScreenFlow 4</a> or <a href="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?grid=9646&id=6PFrOqNV4B8&offerid=162397&type=3&subid=0&tmpid=3664&RD_PARM1=https%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fca%252Fapp%252Ffinal-cut-pro%252Fid424389933%253Fmt%253D12%2526uo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30" target="itunes_store">Final Cut Pro</a>.</p>
<p>Going from the stock 8GB DDR SDRAM to 16GB for $200 would be an upgrade I probably wouldn't do if it was my own money - but since we're playing fantasyland here, why not? Going to 32GB though is excessive.</p>
<p>The $250 upgrade to Apple's new Fusion drive would be a mixture of wanting the performance that an SSD gives you plus curiosity about new tech. An extra $150 would give me a 3TB version which might be good - except that more storage means you just have more to backup. I kind of like having limits - like the 256GB SSD on my MacBook Air - that force me to decide what to keep and what to toss rather than just being a digital packrat.</p>
<p>I'd upgrade the video card to the NVIDIA GeForce GTX 680MX 2GB GDDR5 for $150 but only if it wasn't my money. I don't need it really but it would come in handy for those occasional <a href="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?grid=9646&id=6PFrOqNV4B8&offerid=162397&type=3&subid=0&tmpid=3664&RD_PARM1=https%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fca%252Fapp%252Fmotion%252Fid434290957%253Fmt%253D12%2526uo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30" target="itunes_store">Motion</a> edit sessions or random game that I get 5 minutes to play.</p>
<h3>Sub-total</h3>
<p>So far we're at $2,799 + tax for that configuration.</p>
<p>I'd probably grab the $69 upgrade to the Magic Mouse/Trackpad combo just to have a Trackpad around and throw on the $199 AppleCare. It might be a cash grab for Apple but I can't afford to be fixing an iMac over the next 3 years so it's worth the insurance for me.</p>
<p>So the grand total would be $3,067.00 + tax.</p>
<p>It says a lot about how far the iMac has come and how far the Mac Pro has fallen behind that I wouldn't really even consider a Mac Pro for this kind of setup anymore. If you'd asked me 3 years ago there's no question I'd have jumped straight to the Mac Pro config page if I was looking to upgrade my home studio hardware.</p>
<p>Alright anonymous donor. Time to <a href="https://www.ssktn.com/sponsorship/">step forward</a>.</p>

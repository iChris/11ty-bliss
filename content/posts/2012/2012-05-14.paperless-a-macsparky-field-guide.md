<p>David Sparks, of the <a href="https://5by5.tv/mpu">Mac Power Users podcast</a>, has released a new iBook called <a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/stat?id=6PFrOqNV4B8&offerid=146261&type=3&subid=0&tmpid=1826&RD_PARM1=http%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fca%252Fbook%252Fpaperless%252Fid520393162%253Fmt%253D11%2526uo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30" target="itunes_store">Paperless ($5 in the iBook Store)</a>:</p>

It takes full advantage of iBooks Author and includes picture galleries, interactive images, movies, 32 screencasts, and nearly 27,000 words. There is over an hour and a half of video.

<p>The book is only available for iPad, though David has announced a <a href="https://www.macsparky.com/blog/2012/5/11/paperless-update.html">PDF version will be coming in the future</a>.</p>
<p>If you're not sure about the book or are like me and without an iPad right now, you can listen to <a href="https://5by5.tv/mpu/85">episode 85 of Mac Power Users</a> where David and Katie talk a bit more in depth about the paperless idea for Mac.</p>

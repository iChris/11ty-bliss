<p>If you're a guitar player, getting <a href="https://go2.maclegion.com/SH5B">Capo alone makes it worthwhile</a> as it normally sells for $49.99 - picking up <a href="https://go2.maclegion.com/SH5D">Fantastical</a> and <a href="https://go2.maclegion.com/SH5F">TechTool Pro</a> (normally $99) makes it a really great deal.</p>

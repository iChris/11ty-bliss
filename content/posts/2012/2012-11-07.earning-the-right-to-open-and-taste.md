<blockquote><p>
  Here’s what I recommend: go to a really good liquor store in your area and select the most expensive bottle of whisky that you are comfortable purchasing. Now put it back on the shelf and pick up one that’s twice as expensive. For example, a Laphroaig 18 year old Islay Single Malt ScotchWhisky. And prices can go far higher than this fine bottle. Find the edge of your comfort zone, then blast on past it. Make yourself uncomfortable.

<p>Speaking of new things in iOS 6, Chris Herbert finds a whole bunch of subtle improvements and changes to various apps in iOS6.</p>
<p>One change that I think might confuse folks is in Mail - to be able to mark messages as unread:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  If you want to mark a message as unread from Mail while viewing the message, tap the flag icon and select “Mark as Unread”.
</p></blockquote>
<p>and also you can finally insert a photo or video into an email without having to copy/paste from Photos.app:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Mail can now insert photos and videos from within the app. Tap and hold on the message’s body then select ‘Insert Photo or Video’.
</p></blockquote>

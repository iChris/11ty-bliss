<blockquote><p>
  My take after spending a bunch of the weekend with the iPad mini: This is the real iPad.
</p></blockquote>
<p>I'm still skeptical but I keep reading more reviews of people's experiences with the iPad mini and they all have a similar theme:</p>
<ul>
<li>They love the size and build.</li>
<li>Having used a retina iPad does make it difficult to go back and forth.</li>
<li>More people haven't used a retina iPad than have so they won't be turned off.</li>
<li>There are more people who don't have an iPad than do and a less expensive iPad can only help sell more.</li>
</ul>
<p>I'll be curious to see what people like Dan are using in a few weeks time once the novelty has worn off. My wife has a 1st generation 32GB iPad that we're toying with selling in order to buy an iPad mini. Having a camera for Facetime calls and taking the odd photo of the kids would be a nice upgrade - never mind the speed and easier portability of the iPad mini.</p>
<p>According to current Apple Store shipping estimates, <a href="https://store.apple.com/ca/buy/home/shop_ipad/family/ipad_mini">we've got at least two weeks to decide</a>.</p>

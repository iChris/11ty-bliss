  First, we are introducing a $5/month Member plan. Second, we are dropping the Member price from $50/year to $36/year. All existing members will get the benefits of the yearly price drop.

<p>Smart move. $50/year was just too much for the average person to justify on a social network - even one that promises to not repeat the mistakes of Twitter.</p>

  The membership of App.net is just about to cross the 20,000 user level, which creates some economies of scale for us. Remember, the original pricing model assumed 10,000 users.

<p>20,000 x $50 = $1,000,000. Not to mention some of those initial accounts were $100 developer accounts.</p>

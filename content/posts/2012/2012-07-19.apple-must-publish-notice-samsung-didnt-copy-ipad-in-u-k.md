title: "Apple Must Publish Notice Samsung Didn’t Copy IPad In U.K."

<p>I'd hate to be the lawyers involved that came back to Apple with <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-07-18/apple-must-publish-notice-samsung-didn-t-copy-ipad-judge-says.html">this ruling</a> <em>Via <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2012/07/18/samsung-copy">daringfireball.net</a></em>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Apple Inc. (AAPL) was ordered by a judge to publish a notice on its U.K. website and in British newspapers alerting people to a ruling that Samsung Electronics Co. didn’t copy designs for the iPad.</p>
<p>  As well as Apple’s website, the company must pay for notices in the Financial Times, the Daily Mail, Guardian Mobile magazine, and T3, according to a draft copy of the order provided by Samsung’s lawyers.
</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>
  ...in his July 9 ruling that Samsung’s tablets were unlikely to be confused with the iPad because they are “not as cool.” He declined yesterday to grant Samsung’s bid for an injunction blocking Apple from making public statements that the Galaxy infringed its design rights.
</p></blockquote>
<p>So I guess Apple wins some and loses some.</p>

title: "iPhone 5 Quick Lazy Poll"
---
<p>Just curious what some folks who read this blog / follow me on Twitter are thinking of doing the day before iPhone 5 pre-orders are available. This isn't for any sort of marketing research project other than my own curiosity.</p>
<p>I'll publish the results in a day or two.</p>
<h3>The Poll Begins...</h3>

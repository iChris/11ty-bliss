  “Apple is testing the patience of its fans,” said Tero Kuittinen, an independent analyst and a vice president of Alekstra, a company that helps customers manage cellphone costs.

<p>Apple's dock connector has been <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPod#Connectivity">around for over 10 years</a>. To change it now is not "testing the patience" of their fans. It's making a choice to get rid of a bigger connection for a smaller one - which in turn allows Apple to design a better phone - and eventually iPad.</p>
<p>CNNMoney is also wrong with their assertion that <a href="https://money.cnn.com/2012/09/13/technology/apple-lightning-adapter/index.html">Apple's $30 Lightning adapter won't work with old speakers</a> (<em>Link via <a href="https://twitter.com/danfrakes/statuses/246360845108535296">@danfrakes</a></em>). Just have to ask Apple:</p>

<h3>Apple's Greed</h3>
<p>Yes, Apple will make money by selling new adapters. Apple has made money on a variety of adapters over the years, as do most tech companies. Apple often <sup id="fnref-20737:1"><a href="#fn-20737:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> attempts to make money from the products it sells.</p>
<p>But if you think that Apple is going to hang on to a 30 pin adapter because other companies profited heavily from selling devices based on that adapter, then you clearly haven't been following along with Apple's story long enough.</p>
<p>A list of a few other things Apple has changed because they felt it was best for their customers in the long run:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ditching the floppy drive while "everyone" was still using it.</li>
<li>Moving to USB when hardly anyone had any USB devices.</li>
<li>Getting rid of DVD/CD drives in most of their portables.</li>
<li>Doing away with boxed software and selling direct to customers via the Mac App Store.</li>
<li>Music industry, movie industry, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>The cynic says Apple does it to make money. And that's partially true. The irrational Apple fan says it's just part of <em>the experience</em> of owning a Mac.</p>
<p>The truth is somewhere in between.</p>

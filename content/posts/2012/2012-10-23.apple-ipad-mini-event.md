title: "Apple iPad mini Event"
---
<p>This is the first even in a long time that Apple has live streamed on the web. In addition to that they&#8217;re also streaming to their Apple TV devices so you can watch the event live from the comfort of your couch - which is where I&#8217;m watching it.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s my notes and observations.</p>

<p>I love that Apple is devoting press time to this app - it means it&#8217;s more likely to stick around. I think the potential is huge here for both education publishers as well as self publishers. Getting your own book into the iBook store looking exactly how you want is a great feature and service to offer.</p>

<h2 id="which_ipad_to_buy">Which iPad to Buy?</h2>
<p>I&#8217;m surprised they&#8217;ve kept the iPad 2 in their lineup alongside the 4th generation iPad and the new iPad mini - particularly as they touted all the ways the iPad mini improved upon the iPad 2. If someone was asking me, I&#8217;d say decide on the size you want and then buy. iPad mini for smaller/portable or iPad with Retina Display. </p>
<p>I&#8217;d guess it&#8217;s because they want to hit certain price points, but the iPad mini with 32GB is only $30 more than the iPad 2 with 16GB - why wouldn&#8217;t you go for that if you&#8217;ve got $400 burning a hole in your pocket?</p>

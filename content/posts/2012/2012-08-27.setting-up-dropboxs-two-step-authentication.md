<blockquote><p>
  As with Google’s implementation, Dropbox’s two-factor authentication relies on two separate elements: something you know (a password) and something you have (in this case, a separately generated code). While the combination of these two elements doesn’t guarantee your security, it does make it much harder for a potential hacker to gain access to your account.

<p>Smart way to make your Dropbox more secure. I use the free <a href="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?grid=9646&id=6PFrOqNV4B8&offerid=162397&type=3&subid=0&tmpid=3664&RD_PARM1=http%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fca%252Fapp%252Fgoogle-authenticator%252Fid388497605%253Fmt%253D8%2526uo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30" target="itunes_store">Google Authenticator app for iPhone</a> already for my Google account, so this is easy to set up.</p>
<p>If you're not already using Dropbox to backup and share your documents, <a href="https://chrisenns.com/dropbox">sign up here</a> and we'll both get extra storage space.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: Some recommendations for users of 1Password to <a href="https://blog.agilebits.com/2012/08/27/dropbox-two-step-authentication-1password/">not use this version of Dropbox (yet) from 1Password</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  The bottom line is that I am  strongly recommending that 1Password users not be early adopters of this. Early adopters should:
</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>understand the data security gains and risks thoroughly (discussed below)</li>
<li>take steps to reduce those risks (have great backups), and</li>
<li>be very comfortable using pre-release systems</li>
</ul>

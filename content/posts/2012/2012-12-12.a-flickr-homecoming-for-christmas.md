title: "A Flickr Homecoming for the Holidays"
---
<p>Echoing some of the fun of easily browsing your Instagram stream while allowing you to upload high quality DSLR images to the web, Flickr's updated version of their iOS app (<a href="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?grid=9646&id=6PFrOqNV4B8&offerid=162397&type=3&subid=0&tmpid=3664&RD_PARM1=https%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fca%252Fapp%252Fflickr%252Fid328407587%253Fmt%253D8%2526uo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30" target="itunes_store">free on the App Store</a>) shows that Yahoo isn't letting this property die on the vine.</p>
<p>I'm willing to bet that Flickr will happily play nice with Twitter, unlike <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2012/12/09/it-appears-that-instagram-photos-arent-showing-up-in-twitter-streams-at-all/">Instagram who recently pulled support</a> for showing of their photos in Twitter's cards. To which Twitter responded<sup id="fnref-21047:1"><a href="#fn-21047:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> by <a href="https://blog.twitter.com/2012/12/twitter-photos-put-filter-on-it.html">adding the ability to filter your photos</a>, as if the filters were the thing people flocked to Instagram for.</p>
<p>If Flickr can pull the community back from the various services they've left to (<a href="https://500px.com">500px</a>, Instagram, Facebook, Google+, etc.), then it could be a great homecoming of sorts for one of the first great photo communities on the web.</p>

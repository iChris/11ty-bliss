title: "Telus Allows You to Unlock Your iPhone"
---
<p>For $50 you can unlock your iPhone with Telus.</p>
<p>Here's how, <a href="https://www.telusmobility.com/en/SK/Unlock-Device/unlocking_your_device.shtml">according to Telus</a>:</p>
<ol>
<li>Call Client Care to request the phone unlock. <a href="https://telus.com/call.html">Numbers to call in Canada</a></li>
<li>The Client Care representative will complete the steps to unlock your phone.</li>
<li>Connect your iPhone to iTunes and wait for the message "Unlock Complete. Congratulations, your iPhone has been unlocked. To set up and sync this iPhone, click Continue".<br />
NOTE: NOTE: An Internet connection is required in order for iTunes to unlock your device.</li>
</ol>
<p>I'd add that it's important to note that there's two <strong>NOTE:</strong>'s on Telus' page<sup id="fnref-20465:1"><a href="#fn-20465:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> so that must mean it's very important.</p>
<p>Apple offers a few <a href="https://support.apple.com/kb/HT5014?viewlocale=en_US&amp;locale=en_US">additional suggestions</a> before unlocking your phone - the most important of which is to <a href="https://support.apple.com/kb/HT1766">back it up</a> before you do anything.</p>
<p>Unlocking your iPhone allows you to take it to a different phone carrier - any carrier. Typically when you buy a phone you sign a 3 year contract and the phone you get is locked to, as in will only work with, the phone service you're buying the phone from.</p>

Disgusting.</em></p>

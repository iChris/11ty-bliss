title: "Adding a Forum Like It's 1999"
---
<p>Last night I had the thought that I should setup a forum and link the more popular posts on my blog to the forum for further discussion, questions or comments. Posts like the one on using <a href="https://chrisenns.com/2011/11/airplay-with-apple-tv-and-airport-express/">AirPlay with Apple TV</a> and the <a href="https://chrisenns.com/2012/03/1password-username-password-in-safari-bookmarks/">1Password Username / Safari Bookmark shortcut</a> end up getting a lot of traffic but people tend to just hit that page and leave.</p>
<p>One side of my head says it's not really what people are after. The geeky side of my head likes to have an excuse to play with different software - in this case <a href="https://vanillaforums.org/">Vanilla Forums</a>. My heart loves the idea of building and fostering community. The middle ground is that it can come in handy if someone needs something similar for my <a href="https://lemonproductions.ca">day job</a>.</p>
<p>So <a href="https://chrisenns.com/forum/index.php?p=/discussion/3/kick-the-tires-on-the-new-forum#Item_1">go kick the tires on the new forum and leave a comment</a>. Just like back in 1999.</p>

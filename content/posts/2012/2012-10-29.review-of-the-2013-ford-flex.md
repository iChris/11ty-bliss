<p>Check out <a href="https://www.mydadpodcasts.com/2012/10/reviewing-the-2013-ford-flex/">my review of the 2013 Ford Flex</a> and while you're at it, kick the virtual tires on my new blog: <a href="https://www.mydadpodcasts.com">MyDadPodcasts.com</a>:</p>
<p><a href="https://mydadpodcasts.com" target="_blank"><img src="https://chrisenns.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/MyDadPodcasts.com_-600x376.png" alt="MyDadPodcasts.com" title="MyDadPodcasts.com" width="600" height="376" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-20922" /></a></p>
<p>I've wanted a place to write about stuff that's more family focused - particularly on life with kids and all the stuff besides technology that is going on - yet still written from the perspective of a guy who's into tech, the web and all sorts of other nerdy stuff. Reviews of products we like or get to try, a future podcast with my kids talking about their favourite things and maybe even a guest post or two from my wife if I can coax her into it.</p>
<p>If it was still appropriate I'd put up a "Under Construction" animated GIF on the site but I prefer to just get the site launched as it is and refine it as I go.</p>
<p>So while this site will remain the same Apple focused tech/nerd fest, <a href="https://www.mydadpodcasts.com">MyDadPodcasts.com</a> will be more of a dad/family focused nerd fest. Of course there's the obligatory <a href="https://twitter.com/mydadpodcasts">Twitter</a> and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/My-Dad-Podcasts/366519010099846">Facebook</a> pages as well if you want to follow/like those. Fairly barren for now but more to come.</p>

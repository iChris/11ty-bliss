title: "New Twitter for iPad is Awful, Tweetbot for iPad on Sale"
---
<p>An updated version of Twitter for iOS (iPad and iPhone) is out and not a lot of favourable reviews on my Twitter feed - for whatever that's worth.</p>
<p>Not by coincidence I'm sure, Tweetbot for iPad is on sale</p>

</ul>
<p>Easily my favourite app. I don't even have an iPad (yet?) and I'm tempted to pick up a copy of Tweetbot for iPad just so it's on my account. For now I'll save my money until Tweetbot for Mac is finished.</p>

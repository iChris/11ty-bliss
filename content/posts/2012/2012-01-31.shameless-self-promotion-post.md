title: "Shameless Self Promotion Post"
---
<p>I'm not great at doing the self promotional bits but it needs to be done every so often so that my mum<sup id="fnref-20033:1"><a href="#fn-20033:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> knows where to keep up with all the technical stuff her favourite son is up to.</p>
<h2>Facebook</h2>
<p>There's a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/Faraway-So-Close/263157693732863">Facebook page</a> for this blog that basically just gets a post every time I update this site. If Facebook is your bag, then <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/Faraway-So-Close/263157693732863">like away</a>.</p>
<p>I actually need a few more folks to like it so I can get a less ugly Facebook name than <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/Faraway-So-Close/263157693732863">https://www.facebook.com/pages/Faraway-So-Close/263157693732863</a> so feel free to like it even if you don't, you know, actually like it?</p>
<h2>Twitter</h2>
<p>It's probably a bit backwards but the official Twitter account for this blog is <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/chrisenns">@chrisenns</a>, where my personal Twitter account is <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/ichris">@iChris</a>. But that's just the way it is.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/chrisenns">@chrisenns</a> account is just an auto-tweet with a link of every post that goes out on this site. So again, if Twitter is your preferred way to keep up with sites these days, <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/chrisenns">@chrisenns</a> is where to follow along.</p>
<h2>RSS Subscriptions</h2>
<p>Still my preferred way of keeping up with websites/blogs, but I know it's on the outs for a lot of people in favour of the above methods. But if you'd like to subscribe to the site with an RSS reader, <a href="https://feeds.feedburner.com/mennoboy-chris">https://feeds.feedburner.com/mennoboy-chris</a> is the address to use. Your traditional RSS feed with everything posted, full article in the feed the way it should be and links back to the site/etc.</p>
<h2>Other Stuff</h2>
<ul>
<li>I periodically update my <a href="https://chrisenns.com/recommends/">recommends page</a> with stuff I recommend to folks online.</li>
<li>Lemon Productions, my web consulting business, is located at <a href="https://www.lemonproductions.ca/">https://www.lemonproductions.ca/</a>, or <a href="https://www.twitter.com/lemonproduction">@lemonproduction on Twitter</a> , <a href="https://www.facebook.com/lemonproductionsca">Facebook</a> and <a href="https://feeds.feedburner.com/lemonproductionsblog">RSS subscription</a></li>
<li>SSKTN is where I post podcasts. <a href="https://ssktn.com/">ssktn.com</a>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ssktn">Facebook</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/ssktn">@ssktn on Twitter</a> and <a href="https://ssktn.com/subscribe/">the various links to iTunes for the podcasts themselves</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Thanks</h2>
<p>Thanks for reading, listening, liking and commenting. I really do appreciate and value the little community that gets involved in the stuff I do. Some days it can feel like I'm operating in a vacuum and the comments on my blog, replies on Twitter or feedback for SSKTN all help to remind me why I enjoy this stuff so much.</p>
<p>Ok, enough mushy stuff. Back to Apple fanboy/grumpy tech nerd postings.</p>

I really prefer the British spelling of mum. Something about it seems more warm and fuzzy than mom. Although it may just be that I really wish I had a British accent.&#160;<a href="#fnref-20033:1" rev="footnote">&#8617;</a>

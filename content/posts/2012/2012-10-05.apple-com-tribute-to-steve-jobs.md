<blockquote><p>
  Steve's passing one year ago today was a sad and difficult time for many of us. I hope that today everyone will reflect on his extraordinary life and the many ways he made the world a better place.

<p>Posting this after the <a href="https://chrisenns.com/2012/10/balance/">previous post</a>: It's worth mentioning that in spite of Steve Jobs' great accomplishments at Apple it's sad to know, from reading the <a href="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?grid=9646&id=6PFrOqNV4B8&offerid=162397&type=3&subid=0&tmpid=3664&RD_PARM1=http%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fca%252Fbook%252Fsteve-jobs%252Fid431617578%253Fmt%253D11%2526uo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30" target="itunes_store">Walter Isaacson biography</a>, how much his family apparently suffered for it.</p>
<p>In light of that thought, I think this quote from Steve Jobs is appropriate. He was obviously referring to Apple when he said this at the 1997 Apple World Wide Developers Conference but I know I've often spun it to help me remember to say no to things that will cost me time with my wife and kids:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  People think focus means saying yes to the thing you've got to focus on. But that's not what it means at all. It means saying no to the hundred other good ideas that there are. You have to pick carefully. I'm actually as proud of the things we haven't done as the things I have done. Innovation is saying no to 1,000 things.

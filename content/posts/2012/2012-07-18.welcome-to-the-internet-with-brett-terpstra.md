<p>I had the pleasure of chatting with <a href="https://brettterpstra.com/">Brett Terpstra</a> on my Welcome to the Internet podcast. He's a smart guy who's written a bunch of <a href="https://brettterpstra.com/projects/">interesting apps, utilities and tools</a> for those of us who write, code and work on Macs.</p>

<p>I don't know if it was something in the air yesterday or what, but I kept tripping over my thoughts and words during the interview. Luckily Brett handled it like a pro and he did a great job of answering my meandering questions.</p>

title: "An Alternative to Mail on iPhone"
---
<p>If you've had a love/hate relationship with the included Mail.app on your iPhone or iPod touch, you might want to take a look at <a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/stat?id=6PFrOqNV4B8&offerid=146261&type=3&subid=0&tmpid=1826&RD_PARM1=http%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fca%252Fapp%252Fsparrow%252Fid492573565%253Fmt%253D8%2526uo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30" target="itunes_store">Sparrow ($2.99 in the App Store)</a> - provided you use a Gmail or Google Apps email address.</p>

<h2>Mini Review</h2>
<p>I can't do a proper review because I've already spent too much on apps recently. Maybe next month?</p>
<h2>The Big Con</h2>
<p>The main reason I see people not liking Sparrow for iPhone is that they don't include Push notifications<sup id="fnref-20195:1"><a href="#fn-20195:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>. Personally it's not that big a deal to me because I prefer to check email when I want to check email, not when my Mail app decides to check email. And the <a href="https://lemonproductions.ca">work I do</a> isn't ever that mission critical that an email would make or break something serious - especially when all my clients have my phone number if they really need to get in touch with me.</p>
<p>I also respect <a href="https://sprw.me/push.php">the reason Sparrow's creators give for not having push notifications now</a>. They don't want to have to store your username and password:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  This is a responsibility we're not ready to take. As a startup focused on iOS/OS X development, we do not have the skills to secure your data on our servers and we do not want to put sensitive information at risk. That's why Sparrow iPhone 1.0 doesn't do push.
</p></blockquote>
<p>They tried to do it a different way but Apple wouldn't allow it so for now there's no push.</p>

Push notifications are when an app can automagically notify you of new events, i.e. getting an email, without you having to start the app.&#160;<a href="#fnref-20195:1" rev="footnote">&#8617;</a>

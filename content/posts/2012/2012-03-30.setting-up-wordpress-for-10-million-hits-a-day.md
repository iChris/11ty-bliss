title: "Setting Up WordPress for 10 Million Hits a Day"
---
<p>Using a bunch of geeky commands that go nerdier than I'm typically prepared to, <a href="https://www.ewanleith.com/blog/900/10-million-hits-a-day-with-wordpress-using-a-15-server">here's one way of setting up WordPress so it can handle a bunch of traffic</a>.</p>
<p>WordPress, the CMS that powers this blog, gets a lot of flack for being unable to handle a large traffics spike. But that's typically because it's installed on a cheap server and isn't properly configured.</p>
<p>At the very least install a cache plugin of some sort. I'm using <a href="https://ocaoimh.ie/wp-super-cache/">WP Super Cache</a> here but have been installing <a href="https://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/w3-total-cache/">W3 Total Cache</a> on newer sites as it seems to be what more folks are using.</p>
<p>Your average personal hobby website/blog probably doesn't need it - but if you ever do experience a bit of a traffic spike, you want to make sure all those people can get to your site rather than see a error page and never be able to read your words of wisdom.</p>

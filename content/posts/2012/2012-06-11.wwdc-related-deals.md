<p>Apple has their annual World Wide Developer's Conference this week, with the keynote happening this morning where they're expected to announce <del datetime="2012-06-11T15:41:48+00:00">that they've cured cancer</del>, <del datetime="2012-06-11T15:41:48+00:00">developed a lunar colony</del>, <del datetime="2012-06-11T15:41:48+00:00">solved the mystery of how a Caramilk chocolate bar is made</del>, new updated versions of their hardware and/or software to make Apple nerds drool and fork over their wallets. Oh, and maybe a TV interface of some sort that will revolutionize the way you and I watch TV.</p>
<p><strong>Forever.</strong></p>
<p>In honour of this event, there's a few Mac developers that have put their wares on sale. I'll try and update this post throughout the week if new ones come up that I feel are worth mentioning.</p>

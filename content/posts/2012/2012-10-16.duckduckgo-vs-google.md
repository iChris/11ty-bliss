<p>For more information you can <a href="https://idealab.talkingpointsmemo.com/2012/10/impersonal-google-search-results-are-few-and-far-between-duckduckgo-finds.php">read about the tests DuckDuckGo ran</a> or check out their site <a href="https://dontbubble.us">dontbubble.us</a>.</p>
<p>Obviously it's in <a href="https://duckduckgo.com">DuckDuckGo</a>'s interests if you stop using Google search and start using their search. But even if you don't switch your search engine of choice, it's good to know how much of what you're seeing is filtered or manipulated before it gets to you.</p>

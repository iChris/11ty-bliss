title: "Podcasts - Who Listens?"
---
<p>According to <a href="https://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/click_online/9545533.stm">this article from the BBC</a>, more people listen to podcasts than use Twitter.</p>
<p>Podcasting's greatest strength is also what hinders it from being a sexy buzzword that you'd hear about on the news:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  What podcasting still offers is a chance for anyone to get behind a microphone and, for all intents and purposes, make a radio programme. But even for the biggest in the business, it takes a little time for it to get going.

<p>I'm still trying to figure out my way with podcasting over at <a href="https://www.ssktn.com/">SSKTN</a> - but I still really believe in it as a medium for fostering community, discussion and support in the digital age.</p>

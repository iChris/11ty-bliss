<p>This will appeal to probably less than 1 percent of you, but my mind has been blown by these <a href="https://brettterpstra.com/project/markdown-service-tools/">Markdown Service Tools</a> by <a href="https://brettterpstra.com">Brett Terpstra</a>.</p>
<p>Particularly the 'Links from Safari Tabs'. That alone will save me a ton of time when working on <a href="https://ssktn.com">podcasts</a>.</p>
<p>Found by listening to <a href="https://5by5.tv/mpu/81">episode 81 of Mac Power Users</a>.</p>

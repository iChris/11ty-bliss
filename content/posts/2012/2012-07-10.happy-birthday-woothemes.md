<p>It's WooThemes 4th birthday and they're throwing themselves a party in the form of a big sale.</p>
<p><img src="https://chrisenns.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/WooThemes-600x250.png" alt="WooThemes" title="WooThemes" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-20544" /></p>
<p>I use WooThemes for a lot of my client sites <a href="https://lemonproductions.ca">over at my day job</a> and for a variety of personal projects. You can <a href="https://chrisenns.com/recommends/woothemes/">read about some of my favourite themes on my Recommendations page</a>.</p>
<p>You can get 40% off their <a href="https://zfer.us/f4bxN?d=https://www.woothemes.com/themes/">themes</a> and <a href="https://zfer.us/f4bxN?d=https://www.woothemes.com/extensions/woocommerce-extensions/">WooCommerce Extensions</a> or huge discounts on their <a href="https://zfer.us/f4bxN?d=https://www.woothemes.com/payment/checkout.php?package_id=3">Standard Membership</a> or <a href="https://zfer.us/f4bxN?d=https://www.woothemes.com/payment/checkout.php?package_id=4">Developer Membership</a>.</p>
<p>The sale runs until midnight July 13th 2012 (PST).</p>
<p>Full credit to WooThemes for including a low point, when their site got massively hacked back in April, in their <a href="https://zfer.us/f4bxN?d=https://www.woothemes.com/birthday/">timeline of events on their birthday announcement page</a>. Customer data, money and information was kept secure and they recovered the rest of their site and managed great support along the way.</p>

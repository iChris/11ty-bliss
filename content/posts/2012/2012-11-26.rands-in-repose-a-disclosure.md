title: "Rands In Repose: A Disclosure"

<p>A great article by Michael Lopp from back in 2009 on going from being an engineer in a company to being a manager:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  As best I can tell, there are two useful types of meeting: alignment and creation. Briefly:</p>
<p>  Alignment meetings sound like this: “It’s red, are we all in agreement it’s red? Ok, swell. Wait, Phil thinks it’s blue. Phil, here are the 18 compelling reasons it’s red. Convinced? Done now?”</p>
<p>  Creation meetings sound like this: “We need more blue. How are we going to do that? Phil, you’re our blue man. What should we do here?”</p>
<p>  There are other meetings out there, but you will learn to avoid them. One being the therapy meeting. They sound like this: “Show of hands, who likes to talk about blue? Or red? I don’t care. Let’s explore our color feelings for the next 60 minutes.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>The article is written from the perspective of a tech company, but many principles could easily be applied to other businesses or companies.</p>
<p>Reading it gave me newfound respect for managers at my previous employers.</p>

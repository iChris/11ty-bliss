title: "Sparrow for iPhone on Sale"
---
<p>Sparrow is an email client for iPhone that takes a different approach to your inbox than the default/built-in Mail.app from Apple. It's inspired more by a Twitter client and feels very similar to using a Twitter app if you've ever used one.</p>

<p>I picked it up and am trying it out by using all my regular email accounts on Mail.app and putting my <a href="https://lemonproductions.ca">Lemon Productions</a> account in Sparrow. My thinking is that way I can check work related stuff when I want to - or ignore it when I need to.</p>
<p>Don't be like Francis and miss your opportunity. :)</p>

title: "Apple Announces the iPhone 5"
---
<p><a href="https://store.apple.com/ca/browse/home/shop_iphone/family/iphone">Pre-order September 14th</a> or pick one up in a local store September 21st.</p>
<p>Highlights for me:</p>
<h3>iPhone 5</h3>
<ul>
<li>Larger 4" iPhone that's still thinner and lighter than the previous model. Incredible to think how much <em>stuff</em> they're packing into a mere 7.6 millimetres thin device.</li>
<li>Support for LTE - next generation wireless data communication.</li>
<li>New A6 chip that is faster and powering a bigger display and still gives you 8 hours talk time or up to 10 hours of video playback</li>
<li>New lightning connector. Gone is the large 30 pin connector. Replaced by a smaller (and reversible) connector that will hopefully stick around for as long as the 30 point connector did.</li>
<li>Improved camera with panoramic mode and the ability to take pictures while recording video.</li>
</ul>

<h3>iOS 6</h3>
<p>New version of the operating system for mobile Apple devices. The first one that won't work on original iPads while still apparently working on the iPhone 3GS - though I can't imagine it'll perform all that smoothly. Still pretty incredible for a mobile device that was released in June of 2009 to run a modern operating system that's pushed as aggressively as iOS is.</p>
<ul>
<li>Maps. Meh. </li>
<li>Improved Siri sounds interesting. I don't have Siri on my iPhone 4 and I've yet to see anyone really using it all that much.</li>
<li>Facebook integration. Meh.</li>
<li>Shared Photo Streams will be nice. But I assume it'll still have weird limitations or issues that crop up when trying to share things like that in Apple's narrow view of social sharing.</li>
<li>FaceTime over cellular will be good - so long as Canadian carriers don't block it somehow?</li>
<li>Remodelled aka redesigned iTunes Store, App Store and iBookstore apps. About time.</li>
</ul>

<p>Available September 19th, 2012.</p>

<h3>EarPods</h3>
<p>New earphones. All the marketing speak (years of research!) won't mean anything if they don't sound good. Have to wait and see.</p>

<h3>iTunes Redesign</h3>
<p>A redesign of iTunes that is sorely needed. We'll see if user's needs are trumped by iTunes Store needs - pushing people to buy more stuff in the App Store or iTunes Store vs letting them manage their music library is proving to be a difficult line to walk for Apple.</p>
<p>Coming in October 2012 - <a href="https://www.apple.com/itunes/new-itunes/">details available here</a>.</p>

<p>The one April Fool's day item that's got everyone confused is the possibility of <a href="https://www.google.com">google.com</a> offering email - in the order of 1GB of storage for each user.

Either the news sites end up with egg on their face and we get to laugh, or we get a sweet email service that doesn't have anything to do with <a href="https://www.microsoft.com">the borg</a>.</p>

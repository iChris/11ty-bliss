<p>Continue reading for lyrics from my current favorite off the new album: Sometimes You Can't Make It On Your Own.<br />
<!--more--><br />
Tough, you think you've got the stuff<br />
You're telling me and anyone<br />
You're hard enough</p>
<p>You don't have to put up a fight<br />
You don't have to always be right<br />
Let me take some of the punches<br />
For you tonight<br />
Listen to me now<br />
I need to let you know<br />
You don't have to go it alone</p>
<p>And it's you when I look in the mirror<br />
And it's you when I don't pick up the phone<br />
Sometimes you can't make it on your own</p>
<p>We fight all the time<br />
You and I...that's alright<br />
We're the same soul<br />
I don't need...I don't need to hear you say<br />
That if we weren't so alike<br />
You'd like me a whole lot more</p>
<p>Listen to me now<br />
I need to let you know<br />
You don't have to go it alone</p>
<p>And it's you when I look in the mirror<br />
And it's you when I don't pick up the phone<br />
Sometimes you can't make it on your own</p>
<p>I know that we don't talk<br />
I'm sick of it all<br />
Can - you - hear - me - when - I -<br />
Sing, you're the reason I sing<br />
You're the reason why the opera is in me...</p>
<p>Where are we now?<br />
I've got to let you know<br />
A house still doesn't make a home<br />
Don't leave me here alone...</p>
<p>And it's you when I look in the mirror<br />
And it's you that makes it hard to let go<br />
Sometimes you can't make it on your own<br />
Sometimes you can't make it<br />
The best you can do is to fake it<br />
Sometimes you can't make it on your own</p>

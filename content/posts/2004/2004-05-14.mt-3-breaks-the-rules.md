<p>And not in a good way.  <a href="https://www.movabletype.org/">Movabletype</a> launched the developer's edition of MT3 which gives us a peek at what's in store for the regular joe blow version coming later.  (Acutally they've put out their <a href="https://secure.sixapart.com/">personal license options now</a>) Basically if you have more than one or author and/or more than 3 weblogs on a single site, <a href="https://secure.sixapart.com/">you have to pay.</a>  The Personal Edition will regularly be $99.95US and gives you up to 3 authors and up to 5 weblogs.</p>
<p>On mennoboy we've officially got 4 blogs with 4 authors.  That means I'd really have to look at getting the Personal Edition Volume License 1 for the bargin price of $149.95US.  Ouch.  Not to mention the 8 authors and 4 blogs we have on <a href="https://www.oatways.com">Sue's family site.</a>  <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/mefi/33072#670011">There's a lot of unhappy folks in the blogosphere.</a></p>
<p>I'm really not sure what to do for <a href="https://www.forestgrovecc.com">the site I'm supposed to be redesigining.</a>  I have nothing personally against <a href="https://www.theheresy.com/">LT's system</a>, but it only half works on most Mac browsers and I can't help people use something I can't see.</p>
<p>I'm really hoping the outcry will convince <a href="https://www.sixapart.com/">SixApart</a> (the company that makes MT) to open up the requirements and limitations on their licensing.</p>

<p>A little rain can't stop us from enjoying some fine BBQ'd kabobs.  It's starting to feel a little like <a href="https://www.gov.bc.ca">BC</a> here with the constant drizzle/rain we've been getting.  I think we're happy to put up with it though because the alternative is dry, dusty Saskatchewan.  It should make for a much greener summer!</p>

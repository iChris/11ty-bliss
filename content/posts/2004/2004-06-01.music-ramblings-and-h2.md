<p>I'm sure some of you vaguely remember me prattling on <a href="https://www.mennoboy.com/chris/archives/000083.html">way</a> back <a href="https://www.mennoboy.com/chris/archives/000082.html">when</a> about some band called Pilate that Carlos introduced me to and now that they're getting play on radio and Much you probably hate them because there's some magical rule about a band being played on radio and TV that forces you to hate them even if they write a good tune.  Which is too bad because you'll miss out on a <a HREF="https://www.amazon.ca/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0000CO14V/farawsoclos0a-20">great record</a>.</p>

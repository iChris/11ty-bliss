<p>Is it a hoax for free publicity or is it a real theft:  <a href="https://u2log.com/archive/002845.shtml">Edge left a CD of songs from U2's new album sitting out and it's gone missing.</a></p>
<p>Those paying attention will remember that when the Electrical Storm single was due to come out, somehow a copy fell into the hands of a DJ friend of Bono's who then, "against the band's wishes", played it on air and leaked it to the world.  Much press and MTV time followed for the band.</p>
<p>Countdown to it being available on Kazaa: 5, 4,3....</p>

<p>I got in on the <a href="https://www.movabletype.org">MT 3.0 beta test.</a>  I also got some sort of cold.  So it's a win/lose morning for me.  I've been popping the high-end eichinechia pills like there's no tomorrow so hopefully it doesn't get much worse.</p>
<p>I completed my Flash course last night.  It wasn't too bad as far as courses go and I got a good start into Flash, but I probably could've figured out most of what was taught in 3.5hrs instead of 7hrs.  Next time I'll just go to <a href="https://www.brainfuelmedia.com/postscript">Ryan</a> and get him to teach me.  I'm sure I can bribe him with a steady flow of Timmy Ho's.</p>

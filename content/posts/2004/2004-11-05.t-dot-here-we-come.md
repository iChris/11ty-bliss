<p>Scott, <a href="https://www.flipsaw.com/blog/">Phil</a> and I get to join up with our boss in Toronto this weekend for a conference with all the other campus retailers across Canada.  We get into the T at midnight tonight and then get blasted by all the vendors trying to pitch us their wares in the form of pens, t-shirts and hats.  Sunday we get more of the same and fly out, arriving back home around midnight.</p>
<p>If I have internet access, I'll be dumping pics up on <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lemon/">flickr</a>.</p>

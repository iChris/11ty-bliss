<p>The <a href="https://www.mennoboy.com/chris/archives/000101.html">Carlos Stalker Issue</a> I mentioned before has prompted 26 comments (at present).  It feels a little like high school with lots of anonymous comments floating around which is to be expected on the web.  I always find it interesting when people start telling you what you can and can't put up on your own website.  We're not talking about porn or military secrets here, it's a friggin love letter on a piece of tie-died paper.  Who buys tie-died paper anyways?</p>

<p>HP has sponsored a <a href="https://www.nationalphotoalbum.co.uk">Nation Photo Album</a> of the UK's history.  Very cool.  Some pics are copyrighted and others are public domain - a good resource if you're looking for old pictures to throw into a video or slideshow.</p>
<p><strong>Also check out the <a href="https://beeldbank.nationaalarchief.nl/">Dutch National Image archive</a>.</strong><i> (Thanks Caroline)</i></p>

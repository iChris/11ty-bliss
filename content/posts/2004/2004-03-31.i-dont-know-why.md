<p>I received an email from most@blockauthor.com today.  It reads:</p>
<p><strong>Good afternoon. I don't compete with other discus throwers. I compete with my own history.</strong> <i> What??? What in the h-e-double-hockey-sticks does that mean?</i></p>
<p><strong>Chris, searching for a place to purchase medication? </strong><i> No, not really.  We have these things called Pharmacies that sell medication to me when I give them a piece of paper called money.</i></p>
<p><strong>All the evolution we know of proceeds from the vague to the definite. Older people shouldn't eat health food, they need all the preservatives they can get. I know of nothing more laughable than a doctor who does not die of old age.</strong> <i> Hahaha... that's hilarious Most!  You tell the best jokes!</i></p>
<p><strong>We are able to ship worldwide.</strong><i> Ship what?  Discus throwers?</i></p>
<p><strong>Old things are always in good repute, present things in disfavor.</strong> <i> Very good point.  I'll take that into consideration while I'm taking my crazy pills.</i></p>

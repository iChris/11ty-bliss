<p>Joel gave his right eye to see Pilate last night.  I gave up 2 hours of my life listening to 2 other crappy bands (Boy and Memory Bank) before finally getting to the good stuff.</p>
<p>It was akin to having to wade through mushroom-capped something appetizers to get to your steak.  But man was it a good steak.</p>
<p>Mmmm.... steak.</p>

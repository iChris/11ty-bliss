<p><a href="https://music.download.com/">Mp3.com is back</a> only it's been bought out by download.com and has a fancy new interface.  It's in beta right now but you can go and sign up and get your artist name locked in before everyone else.</p>
<p>You're limited to 50MB per artist, but you can have as many artists as you want - though they say they'll kill any duplicate names (i.e. No Method, No Methods, etc) if you attempt to gain more space that way.</p>
<p>Right now you can only put your songs up there to be downloadable.  There's no streaming option since they're still working out the kinks.</p>

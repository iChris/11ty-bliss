<p>We would have some amazing photos from our two day retreat up north at Christopher Lake, but Sue decided it would be a good idea to leave the camera at home in case someone broke in to our place and wanted to leave us a picture of what they took.</p>
<p>Or something like that.</p>
<p>I'm feeling very disjointed right now.  <a href="https://ccs.usask.ca">The Store</a> has slowed down a bit, but one of my co-workers has left and so there's some extra work for everyone.  A plus to it is that now I'm the 'official' Apple guy.  Until we hire someone new, all it really means is that there's more work to go around - but hopefully once things settle down I'll be able to focus on work that I enjoy a little more.</p>
<p><a href="https://houseofworship.blogspot.com/">HoW</a> band practice tonight and a <a href="https://www.forestgrovecc.com">FGCC</a> practice tomorrow night and somehow I've got to come up with a concept/design for a video/slideshow for Sunday a.m.  I love the stuff I get to do, I just wish I had more time for all of it.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.theheresy.com/">LT</a> came over on Saturday night and gave me a hand with setting up my machine as a server.  I still have to figure out how to get PHP support going as well as access remotely to my box (through a slick little add-in called <a href="https://www.webmin.com/">webmin</a>) - then I'll try and get <a href="https://www.movabletype.org">MT</a> running.</p>
<p>But I did manage to get it running as web server.  FTP is still not functional but I've managed to get a basic web page going.</p>

<p>As I'm starting to help more and more people set up a MT blog, here's some great sites I've found that give you a great boost when working with <a href="https://www.movabletype.org">MovableType</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.elise.com/mt/">Learning MovableType</a> by Elsie.  Great bunch of resources with lots of code you can just copy and paste into your own templates</li>
<li><a href="https://www.scriptygoddess.com/">Scriptygoddess.com</a>: Another great site, a little more advanced as far as how they explain things but some very cool (aka nerdy) stuff</li>
<li><a href="https://www.thegirliematters.com/tips/">thegirliematters.com</a>: What is it about girls and putting up MT support sites?  Another good site of tips and tricks by a brand new employee of MT</li>
<li>And finally, there's always the <a href="https://www.movabletype.org/support/">Official MovableType Support Forum</a> which has tons of newbie questions answered in an easily, searchable forum.  Just make sure you actual search for your problem before asking, people get annoyed if they have to answer something that's already been done before.</li>
</ul>

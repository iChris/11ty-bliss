<p>So they announced a new U2 iPod.  (You can catch the quicktime stream of the event <a href="https://stream.apple.akadns.net/">here</a>) I wouldn't kick it out of bed for eating crackers, but I wouldn't go and spend an extra $110 above the cost of the regular 20GB iPod to get it either.  I am, however, scheming up a way to get the new 60GB iPod Photo.  That has potential to get some serious use.  And with the S-Video/RCA output on it, I'm sure they'll be adding video out on it eventually.  I don't care about watching it on the little 2" screen, but it'd be sweet to be able to take a movie I'm working on, dump it on the iPod and just take that to a meeting and show it on a TV or projector.</p>
<p>Is there any mennogals out there that want to join <a href="https://www.mennoboy.com/jenjie/">Jenn</a> as we set up a mennogal/mennoladies/something?  Mennogirl.com is apparently taken?  The cost goes down as more people join!  :)</p>

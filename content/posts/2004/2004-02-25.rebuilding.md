title: Rebuilding
---
<p>Just to update anyone wondering, the server my blog was hosted on crashed and lost everything I had put up in the last year or so.  Don't feel sorry for me though, I should've been doing backups.  It's the same thing as opening an email that says "Here's a sweet screensaver!" with an attachment titled "annakornikova.exe".</p>
<p>So since I have to rebuild, I'm going to start from the ground up and redesign and incorporate a photo section now that we've got a digital camera.</p>
<p>In the meantime, go <a href="https://www.sr.se/cgi-bin/p1/src/sing/default.asp">get a song sung for you</a> and <a href="https://www.casper.ru/temp/pingu3/?namn=422">play a game of smack the penguin</a>.</p>

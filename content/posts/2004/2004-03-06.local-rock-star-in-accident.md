<p>I was going to try and set this up as a news report but then I thought it might freak some people out and not realize that Travis is okay.</p>
<p>After Junior High we thought we'd setup a screen, use the projector and sound system that was set up in the lounge and watch a movie since Shannon had to stick around until 3am as a night-host for the 24/7 prayer room.  We dispatched Travis to go get <a HREF="https://www.amazon.ca/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00018YCHS/farawsoclos0a-20">School of Rock</a> while the rest of us setup the equipment.  Turns out while Trav was driving through the intersection at Central and Attridge a lady decided she had enough time to cut across Attridge to the other side, forgetting that she was sitting on a patch of ice (also forgetting that she was a dumbass...  had to say it for Travis).  Luckily nobody was hurt and the main thing lost will be Trav's car to an SGI write-off.  The lady seemed really apologetic: "What am I going to do.... oh this totally ruins my week... I was having such a good time with friends...  oh, what am I going to do."  (that's sarcasm kiddies)  We still gave her a ride home so now we know where she lives so we can go egg her house sometime or something.</p>

<p>Oh, and since we didn't feel like driving all the way to Trav's house we ended up watching the first disc of the <a HREF="https://www.amazon.ca/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00009TB5G/farawsoclos0a-20">The Two Towers: Extended Edition</a> instead.  Such a great show.  I still have the second disc as well as two discs of tasty extras to go through on that one.</p>

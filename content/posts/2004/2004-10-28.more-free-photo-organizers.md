title: "More Free Photo Organizers"
---
<p>I think <a href="https://www.picasa.com/content/download.php?sourceid=awd&amp;subid=ha-picbd&amp;cv=1">Picasa</a> is still the best iPhoto clone out there for Windows users, but Microsoft has just released <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/using/digitalphotography/photostory/default.mspx">Photo Story 3</a> for free for anyone using WinXP.</p>
<p>Someone on a WinXP box try it out and let me know how well it works.  It's getting <a href="https://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/2004/10/28.html#a8529">rave reviews on some blogs</a>, but then he works for Microsoft.</p>

<p>Mennoboy is on the move.  We're in the process of switching hosts to more space, theoretically better servers and that kind of thing.  There may be disruptions in our email/web sites over the weekend and into next week.  If you're sending an email to a mennoboy (or mennogirl) and it bounces, just keep trying until it goes through.</p>
<p>That or pick up the phone and call.  Crazy thought, hey?</p>

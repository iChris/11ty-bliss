<p>As you can see, we're updating the look of our <a href="https://www.mennoboy.com/">main page to better assist you in finding suitable reading to your tastes.  As with most web pages, it's a work in progress but I avoided putting up the <a href="https://www.acme.com/jef/construction/">under construction</a> animated GIF.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.mennogirl.ca">mennogirl.ca</a> is coming.  But it's taking <a href="https://www.dotster.com">dotster.com</a> forever and a day to figure out how to actually let me register it.  Dotser is dotstupid.</p>

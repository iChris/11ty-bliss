<p>Alright, so I did a bit of work on the page.  Waddya think?  I'm not completely satisfied and obviously the links in the top menu bar don't go anywhere (or look like links for that matter) but it's getting there.</p>
<p>Is the font too small?  Sue thinks it is, I think anything larger looks like crap so I'm not sure where to go.  I don't mind it but then I've got 20/20 contacts.</p>
<p>If this text doesn't go down far enough, then the picture starts to overlap the entry below.  Hrmmm...  guess I'll just have to always be long-winded if I want to post like this.</p>

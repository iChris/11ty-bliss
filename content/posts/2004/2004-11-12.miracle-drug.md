<p>Lyrics from one of my current favs on the new U2 album:</p>
<p>I want to trip inside your head<br />
Spend the day there...<br />
To hear the things you haven't said<br />
And see what you might see</p>
<p>I want to hear you when you call<br />
Do you feel anything at all?<br />
I want to see your thoughts take shape<br />
And walk right out</p>
<p>Freedom has a scent<br />
Like the top of a new born baby's head<br />
<!--more--><br />
The songs are in your eyes<br />
I see them when you smile<br />
I've seen enough I'm not giving up<br />
On a miracle drug</p>
<p>Of science and the human heart<br />
There is no limit<br />
There is no failure here sweetheart<br />
Just when you quit...</p>
<p>I am you and you are mine<br />
Love makes nonsense of space<br />
And time...will disappear<br />
Love and logic keep us clear<br />
Reason is on our side, love...</p>
<p>The songs are in your eyes<br />
I see them when you smile<br />
I've had enough of romantic love<br />
I'd give it up, yeah, I'd give it up<br />
For a miracle, a miracle drug, a miracle drug</p>
<p>God I need your help tonight</p>
<p>Beneath the noise<br />
Below the din<br />
I hear your voice<br />
It's whispering<br />
In science and in medicine<br />
"I was a stranger<br />
You took me in"</p>
<p>The songs are in your eyes<br />
I see them when you smile<br />
I've had enough of romantic love<br />
I'd give it up, yeah, I'd give it up<br />
For a miracle, miracle drug</p>
<p>Miracle, miracle drug</p>

<p>Spent the last week up north with a group of youth leading fun camps for 30-40 kids in a small town.  Coming home and seeing all the work related emails really has me questioning working at a computer store again.  Spending my day finding a really good deal on a computer for someone just doesn't hold the same appeal for some reason.</p>
<p>It's part of coming down from a trip like that, I know, so I'll hold off writing a letter of resignation right now :).  It's good to have reminders like this past week has been that there's a whole lot more to life though.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.tsn.ca/nba/news_story.asp?id=105300">Disgusting.</a>  There is quite literally no excuse for a professional sports player leaving the playing field and going into the stands and punching fans.  No matter what they're saying about your mama, no matter what they throw at you.</p>
<p>I hope they ban the players involved from the game.  Realistically they may get a season suspension, but who knows.  As they say, no press is bad press these days.</p>

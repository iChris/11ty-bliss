<p>If you're off work or killing time between classes today, check out the Apple tent set up in the Bowl on campus.  The usual propaganda but they brought one of their schweet new displays that everyone's drooling about.</p>
<p>Plus all the free Apple pens, notebooks, flashlights, etc that you can handle.</p>

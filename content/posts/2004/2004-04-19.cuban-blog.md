<p>No, this is not something to do with the Cuban controversy brewing over at <a href="https://www.mennoboy.com/bigboots/">Matt's place</a>.  I found out from <a href="https://www.jordoncooper.com/">jordoncooper.com</a> that <a href="https://www.nba.com/mavericks/news/cuban_bio000329.html">Mark Cuban</a>, owner of the <a href="https://www.nba.com/mavericks/">Dallas Mavericks</a>, has a <a href="https://www.blogmaverick.com/">personal blog</a> that he updates fairly regularly.  Apparently he also responds to most of the emails he gets from fans/customers.  Amazingly enough, he uses their ideas and suggestions to better the experience customers have when they go to a Maverick's game.</p>
<p>Imagine that?  A rich, billionare CEO who listens to his customers.  Do you know of any other interesting blogs like this?  And don't tell me about Paul Martin's blog - it hasn't been updated in forever and was probably just some Liberal employee typing it for him anyway.</p>

<p>I got SSH working!  After frustrating over it for a couple of hours last night I finally tracked it down to the hosts.allow file only allowing local calls to 'SSH'.  Once I fixed that, everything works fine.  Now if only I could get webmin to start working I'd be set.</p>
<p>I know.. pathetic.  But I have to win <a href="https://bloglos.kicks-ass.net/archives/000148.html">the office pool.</a></p>

<p>I've got the links working along the top.  Nothing really on them yet except for the five2nine: year two video.</p>
<p>For the nerds out there I've basically created 4 seperate blogs (regular blog, music, movies, photos) and am just using a single <a href="https://www.mennoboy.com/chris/menu.php">menu.php</a> file to load the menu system so I don't have to go through and change all the individual index pages each time I want to update the main menu.</p>
<p>The movie page basically takes the movies I've uploaded to my <a href="https://www.mac.com">mac.com</a> page and presents them as if they're on my own site.  That way the bandwidth is being used up by Apple's servers and yet still looks like a local file.  Very nerdy and very cool.</p>

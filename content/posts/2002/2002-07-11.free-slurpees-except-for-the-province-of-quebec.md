<p>Apparently today is free slurpee day at 7-11 since today is 7/11.</p>
<p>Of course, they have to have it on a day when I've got a sore throat and shouldn't be drinking slurpees.</p>
<p>Anyway, for those of you who don't have sore throats and don't live in Quebec (sorry Matt!) go grab yourself a free slurpee!</p>

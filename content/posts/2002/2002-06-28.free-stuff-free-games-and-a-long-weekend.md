<p>No "Friday Funny" Ã´ picture today, but just some good fun web wanderings:</p>
<p>If you like R.E.M. and haven't got this already, they're giving away 10 remixes (though it's actually only 6 different songs) on their website.</p>
<p>To get in the whole world cup spirit, check out Ultimate Soccer Showdown (some flash req'd).</p>
<p>Two ebay auctions for the person that has everything. First is Christopher Walken's suit from Suicide Kings, size large for anyone interested. Also, you can get yourself your own Sony Jumbotron - I know I could use one in my basement.</p>

<p>Since I haven't done one of these in awhile, here's some stuff I've found on the web:</p>
<p>- Doughboy (flash req'd) - no explanation necessary<br />
- Apple plans on having real jaguar's in their stores upon the release of their new operating system, codename Jaguar. (satire warning)<br />
- Not for the easily disturbed: the BBC looks into where all the old computers go after they die<br />
- web nerds like myself should check out webmonkey for some great web design tips<br />
- These churchgoers were upset about getting a parking ticket while they were in church - giving us the quote of the week:</p>
<p>"People shouldn't have to go to church and worry about getting a ticket"</p>
<p>That's it for me... have a great weekend!</p>

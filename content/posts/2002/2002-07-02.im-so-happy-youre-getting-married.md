<p>As I type this there are at least 8 girls downstairs celebrating Dana's engagment with what they like to call a 'Bridal Shower.' I don't really need to point out that there's no sign of any shower happening, so I won't. Vast amounts of chips and chocolate will be consumed things that it's probably best I don't know about will be discussed.</p>
<p>It's funny how a lot of our friends have reached the magic age of 25 and are starting to get paired off. I don't think it's panic or anything because nobody's rushed into a relationship that they shouldn't really be in, but it is kind of funny how last year at this time hardly anybody was even dating and now most everyone is engaged.</p>
<p>Except for Darren.</p>
<p>But that's ok because Darren's okay. Although he sounds a little less confident in his single-ness now that he's one of the few left (in our friendship group obviously). So, wherever you are tonight - raise a pint to Darren and wish him luck in his pursuit of his mystery lady who is out there somewhere, wondering where her intellectually stimulating unworldly loner of a man is.</p>

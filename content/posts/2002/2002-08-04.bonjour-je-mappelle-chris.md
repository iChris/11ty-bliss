<p>We watched 'Amelie' last night and enjoyed it a lot. (M&amp;H you'll love the french - Heidi could probably even watch it without subtitles by now I bet!) A very cute, funny movie. I was really impressed with the whole look of the film - the camera angles, the over-saturated colors - very well done. Some of the extras on the DVD were interesting, some were boring and some we didn't watch.</p>
<p>Two thumbs up from this household.</p>
<p>We're off to the lake so don't expect much in the way of updates. Watch Mark's site for possibly more updates - or possibly not.</p>

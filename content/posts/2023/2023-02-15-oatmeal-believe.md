The Oatmeal with a great comic - [sweary](https://theoatmeal.com/comics/believe) or [clean](https://theoatmeal.com/comics/believe_clean) - on how difficult it is for each of us to change our beliefs, even when confronted with overwhelming facts.

The examples are USA focused, but the message remains true. Be sure to check out the *Inspiration* section at the bottom for more listening and reading on the topic, including [Wikipedia's list of common misconceptions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_common_misconceptions).

Rach Smith, in a post titled [AI is making it easier to create more noise, when all I want is good search](https://rachsmith.com/i-want-good-search/), nails what most of us want out of AI:

> What I would use the shit out of, though, is a chatbot that has been trained on all the information in the [CodePen](https://codepen.io) knowledge base. Have it suck in all the meeting notes, project board cards, and weekly reports, and then be able to answer questions about the content (and provide links to the original docs).

...and what's wrong with the use case for AI that gets talked about and seems to get the funding:

> There’s been a lot of hype around AI-written content. If you ask me, if there’s one thing we don’t need more of on the internet, it is more soulless content written for “SEO” purposes, with enough wordcount to inject ads between.

The helpful version of AI Rach describes sounds like [HoustonAI](https://houston.astro.build/) that [Astro](https://astro.build) is experimenting with. Something to keep an eye on.

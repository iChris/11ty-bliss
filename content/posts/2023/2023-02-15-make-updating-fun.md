Each time I use [Arc](https://arc.net), a new web browser based on the Chromium engine, and I see the notification in the corner telling me that "Arc is ready to update!", it puts a little smile on my face.

Thank you to [The Browser Company of New York](https://thebrowser.company) for not burying it in a menu or deep inside a Settings screen.

As a bonus, the [release notes they publish for Arc](https://arc.net/e/F14CC87A-5740-4173-9AEF-6238BF1AF8B2) are also really fun to read - and make use of one of Arc's features, the easel. I haven't figured out a workflow that makes sense for my usage, but I feel like there's untapped potential there for me - possibly for [recording show notes for client's podcasts](https://www.lemonproductions.ca/portfolio/) I'm editing?

If you want to try out Arc, there's a few invites left [at my invite link](https://arc.net/gift/53933bc1). Feel free to [message me on Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@ichris) to see if I have more invites if that link doesn't work.

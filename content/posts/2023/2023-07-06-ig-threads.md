Instagram launching their Twitter clone Threads - [I'm @iChrisv2 on Threads](https://www.threads.net/@ichrisv2) - built off the social graph you have on Instagram is such a smart play. Despite having a massive amount of users on Facebook, they're not leveraging that platform to boost Threads in part because that would be a huge turn off to all the people looking for *anything* to leave the sinking Twitter ship. As far as I can tell, they haven't even told Instagram users about Threads yet. I'm sure both platforms will eventually be pushed to Threads.

### It's Only Been a Day

Threads hasn't been publicly available for 24 hours, and people are already proclaiming things with 100% certainty about it:

* "It's so fresh and new here like the first day of school!" (*Every social media platform feels that way at first until the marketers, ads, and bots ruin it for everyone.*)
* "Here's how to use Threads for success and profit!" (*See first statement about marketers*)
* "Threads is ruining our lives because it's collecting data and using your posts for machine learning evil!" (*Very possible. But if you're already on Instagram you've been feeding Meta your data for a while.*)

What I think is going to be fascinating about Threads is how Meta is attempting to thread (ha!) the needle on bringing very different worlds together on one platform. Twitter users have a very different style and vibe than Instagram than Facebook than Tumblr, etc. And yet Threads feels like it's trying to go after all of them in a way. And when Meta does turn on the Facebook tap and suddenly your mom, that weird uncle, and friend from high school you've been ignoring starts following your Threads - there's no longer that nice Twitter vs Facebook wall that used to keep those two worlds apart.

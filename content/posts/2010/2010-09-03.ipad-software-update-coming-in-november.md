<p>One of the announcements from Wednesday's Apple event (<a href="https://www.apple.com/apple-events/september-2010/">re-watch it over and over again!</a>) was that in November the iPad is getting the same update as the iPhone is getting next week, iOS 4.2.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.apple.com/ipad/software-update/">Here's a page</a> detailing the updates that will be new to iPad owners, including multi-tasking, printing and Airplay ("Wirelessly stream videos, music, and photos from iPad to the new Apple TV, and stream music to AirPlay speakers or receivers, including AirPort Express.")</p>
<p>The iOS 4.2 update will be a free update.</p>

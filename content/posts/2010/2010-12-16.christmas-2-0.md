<p>The story of the nativity as told using social media:</p>
<p>My prediction: this will be played at many churches in an attempt to illustrate how hip to the internet said churches are when if you send them a message to their Twitter account, you'll never get a reply and if you click the button linking to their Flickr account on their website, they never setup a Flickr account - the button is only there because it was included in the free template they are using for their website.</p>
<p>Hypothetically speaking, of course.</p>

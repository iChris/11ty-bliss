<p>Too bad it came out after my birthday:</p>
<p><img src="https://chrisenns.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/27inchdisplay.jpg" alt="" title="27inchdisplay" width="420" height="295" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-14879" /></p>
<p><a href="https://store.apple.com/ca/product/MC007?mco=MTkwMzgyNjg">$1,099 gets you</a> one of the nicest monitors around.</p>
<p>What's crazy is that for <a href="https://store.apple.com/ca/browse/home/shop_mac/family/imac?mco=MTcyMTgwNTQ">$700 more</a> you can get a full iMac along with that display.</p>

title: "FaceTime From the Future"
---
<p>I realize most of us are pretty jaded and just assume technology should be able to do everything and anything because, well, it's technology.  But this whole <a href="https://www.apple.com/mac/facetime/">FaceTime</a> thing is really incredible if you think about it.</p>
<p>This is a screenshot from my iPhone making a video call (<em>FaceTime in Apple speak</em>) back to our iMac.</p>

<p>The iPhone is a device that is <a href="https://www.apple.com/iphone/specs.html">9.93mm (0.37 inch) thin</a> and you're able to make video calls on it.  If that doesn't blow your mind think of where mobile/cell phone technology was 4 years ago before the iPhone came out.  One of the most popular was a <a href="https://www.google.ca/images?client=safari&rls=en&oe=UTF-8&redir_esc=&q=motorola+razr&um=1&ie=UTF-8&source=univ&ei=aavATJKpFYegnQfpldT-CQ&sa=X&oi=image_result_group&ct=title&resnum=4&ved=0CEYQsAQwAw&biw=1288&bih=671">Motorola Razr</a>.  Give your head a shake and recognize how far we've come.</p>
<h3>Amazing.</h3>
<p>Right now FaceTime is limited to wifi (aka internet) connections between iPhones, iPod touches or Mac computers since to try and do it over the cellular data networks would require a level of contract negotiations that even Apple couldn't pull off right now.  But it's only a matter of time.</p>
<p>(The iPhone isn't the only portable device to do this - it's just the first one that I've owned and that is this thin)</p>

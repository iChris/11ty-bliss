title: "Apple Passes Microsoft in Market Capitalization"
---
<p>Wow:</p>
<blockquote><p>In the less-than-three months since Apple first passed Wal-Mart to hold the third highest market capitalization among U.S. companies, Apple's stock price has continued to increase while second-place Microsoft has seen its shares drift downward.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Market capitalization is a popular metric for assessing the size of a company as a representation of the investing public's notion of the company's worth. The figure is derived by simply multiplying the number of outstanding shares of the company's stock by the share price.</p></blockquote>
<p>Many of you probably don't remember a world where Apple was very seriously on the brink of being done and was the butt of many jokes in the computer sales world.  Quite a turn around.</p>
<p>Apple does a great job of generating a large amount of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind_share">mind share</a> (i.e. it feels like <strong>everyone</strong> has a Mac/iPhone/etc. when they are still actually in the 8%-12% market share) so it seems like it would be obvious and a given that Apple would be doing better than Microsoft.</p>

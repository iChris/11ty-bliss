<p>I've resurrected my <a href="https://blog.lemonproductions.ca">blog over at Lemon Productions</a> with a bit of a renewed focus.</p>
<p><img src="https://chrisenns.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/bloglemonproductions-300x136.png" alt="" title="Lemon Productions Blog" width="300" height="136" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-12345" /></p>
<p>I'll have a thought or two throughout the week related to running an online business and felt like I didn't want to bore readers of this site (<em>Hi Mom!</em>) with that kind of stuff.  And then I remembered that I have a freelance online business myself that I could promote with writing about running an online business and <strong>SHAZAM!</strong> - synergy!</p>
<p>I have a pretty low tolerance for words like "synergy", "fourth quarter profits", "calls to action" and "maximizing our earning potential" so you won't find much of that kind of stuff on <a href="https://blog.lemonproductions.ca">the Lemon Productions blog</a> - the stuff you'll find will be more like the kind of thing I might chat with you about over a drink, an idea that I can't get out of my head.</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://feeds.feedburner.com/lemonproductionsblog">subscribe in your RSS reader</a> or just <a href="https://blog.lemonproductions.ca">head over to the site</a>.</p>
<p>p.s.  If you lurv the typography and <a href="https://shop.simplebits.com/product/ampersandwich-tee">sexy ampersands</a> on the blog as much as I do be sure to hit up <a href="https://twitter.com/mattwiebe">Matt Wiebe</a> - <a href="https://somadesign.ca/">a web designer based in Winnipeg</a> who did the WordPress theme.  I can't guarantee I'll keep that theme forever (<em>I tend to be a bit schizophrenic with my own sites</em>) but it's a great start.</p>

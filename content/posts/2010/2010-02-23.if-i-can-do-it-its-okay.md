title: "If I Can Do It, It&#039;s Okay"

<p>I'm constantly amazed at how people justify things in the electronic world with the line that I can do it, so it's ok and how dare you even bring up the fact that I'm stealing:</p>

<p>I'm not going to stand on some high horse and say that I've never done it - but call a spade a spade.  You're breaking the law.  It doesn't matter if it's annoying/frustrating/easy to do/etc.  You're breaking the law.  Here's a few in case you're not aware:</p>
<ul>
<li>Install software that you don't have a license for.  <em>But I have a copy of Windows on my old machine that I sold to a friend and kept the CD so why I can't I just install it?? Waaaaah!  I'm going to stick my fingers in my ears and put my head in the sand.  I can't hear you!  I can't hear you!</em></li>
<li>Walk into 7-11, take an Oh Henry bar and put it in your pocket and leave without paying for it.</li>
</ul>
<p>Acknowledge that what you're doing is wrong.  Own up to it and make an attempt to do right the next time.</p>

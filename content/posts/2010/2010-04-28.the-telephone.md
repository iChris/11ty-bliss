<p>Stop shouting:</p>
<blockquote><p>“The telephone was an aberration in human development. It was a 70 year or so period where for some reason humans decided it was socially acceptable to ring a loud bell in someone else’s life and they were expected to come running, like dogs. This was the equivalent of thinking it was okay to walk into someone’s living room and start shouting. It was never okay.”</p></blockquote>
<p>The answer the original author gives is text messaging.  I'd say most people don't know how to <strong>not</strong> respond to a text message alert either.  Resist the urge to always respond to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_conditioning">bell</a>.</p>

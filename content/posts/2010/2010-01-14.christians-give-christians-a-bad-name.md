title: "Christians Give Christians a Bad Name"

<p>I'm thinking that Jesus must sometimes be shaking His head and wondering why He got involved with the Christians:</p>
<blockquote><p>Pat Robertson <a href="https://www.salon.com/news/haiti/index.html?story=/news/2010/01/13/haiti_robertson">thinks that Haiti is poverty stricken</a> (and earthquake-stricken) because the country made a deal with Satan to help them overthrow the French.</p></blockquote>
<p>and this follow up:</p>
<blockquote><p>Back in May, the <a href="https://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/us_and_americas/article6281614.ece">Times Online provided some slightly better insight</a> into Haiti's past. Beyond a vague assumption that Imperialism had probably screwed Haiti somehow, I didn't know much about the country's history. Reading this story has been nothing short of nauseating.</p>
<p>Summary: Haiti was forced to pay France for its freedom. When they couldn't afford the ransom, France (and other countries, including the United States) helpfully offered high-interest loans. By 1900, 80% of Haiti's annual budget went to paying off its "reparation" debt. They didn't make the last payment until 1947. Just 10 years later, dictator Fran√ßois Duvalier took over the country and promptly bankrupted it, taking out more high-interest loans to pay for his corrupt lifestyle. The Duvalier family, with the blind-eye financial assistance of Western countries, killed 10s of thousands of Haitians, until the Haitian people overthrew them in 1986. Today, Haiti is still paying off the debt of an oppressive dictator no one would help them get rid of for 30 years.</p>
<p>The rest of the world refuses to forgive this debt.</p>
<p>So, in a way, maybe Robertson is right. Haiti is caught in a deal with the devil, and the devil is us.</p></blockquote>

<p>In spite of (or perhaps because of) Pat Robertson's ignorance and stupidity, there continues to be an <a href="https://mashable.com/2010/01/13/haiti-red-cross-donations/">outpouring of support for Haiti</a>, thanks to efforts by the Red Cross:</p>

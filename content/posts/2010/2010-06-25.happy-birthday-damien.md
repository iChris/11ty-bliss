title: "Happy Birthday Damien!"

<p>It was Damien's 3rd birthday yesterday so we had a little supper/birthday cupcake party with his friend Sofia that can't make it to the bigger party on Saturday (<em>rain, rain, go away, come again after Damien's birthday... party.</em>).</p>

<p>Things got a little crazy.  Someone spiked the fruit juice with extra sugar and then pulled out some fake glasses with eyebrows on them and it got real nutty in a hurry.</p>

title: "Nerd Alert: Droplr Screencast"
---
<p>So I was bored last night and came up with this:</p>

<p>Do you ever watch screencasts/ video tutorials on software?  What do you or don't you like about them?  How did I do in explaining <a href="https://www.droplr.com">Droplr</a>?</p>
<p><em>Link to video on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HqWFpd6IIqk">Youtube</a> if you prefer.</em></p>
<p>Video, high definition video in particular, on YouTube has really improved lately.  I've generally steered clear of <a href="https://youtube.com/user/pbooker">YouTube</a> for most of my video uploads in favour of <a href="https://vimeo.com/ichris76">Vimeo</a> but it certainly has gotten a lot better.</p>

<h2>YouTube:</h2>
<p><a href="https://chrisenns.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/youtube1.png"><img src="https://chrisenns.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/youtube-300x189.png" alt="" title="YouTube" width="300" height="189" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-2045" /></a></p>
<p>But even in that department YouTube has made some improvements.</p>

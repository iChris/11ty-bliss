title: "Conan O&#039;Brien on 60 Minutes"
---
<p>Surprisingly the <a href="https://www.deadline.com/2010/05/conan-obriens-full-60-minutes-transcript/">interview is only 15 minutes and not 60 minutes</a> as the show name implies.</p>
<blockquote><p>STEVE KROFT: Well, I think most people think you got screwed.  I mean, Jay Leno thinks you got screwed.  Jay Leno thinks he got screwed.</p>
<p>CONAN O'BRIEN: How did he get screwed again?  (LAUGHTER) Explain that part to me.  I'm sorry. Jay's got The Tonight Show.  I have a beard and an inflatable bat.  And I'm touring city to city.  Who can (LAUGHTER) say who won and who lost?  I'm laughing 'cause crying would be sad. </p></blockquote>

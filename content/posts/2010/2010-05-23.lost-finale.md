<p>Yes I know how funny it is to point out that "the writer's never really knew where things were going" and that "the smoke monster is lame" and how important it is for you to let everyone know you quit watching after the 2nd or 3rd season because that's "when it jumped the shark/started going downhill/insert other reason" so save your witty comment for another time.</p>

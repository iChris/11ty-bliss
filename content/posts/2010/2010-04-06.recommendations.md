<p>You may (<em>or may not?</em>) have noticed a new page link up on the top navigation of this site labelled <a href="https://chrisenns.com/recommendations/">Recommendations</a>.  I get the occasional question about what I'd recommend for doing various things on the internet, so I thought I'd put the answers into one place.</p>
<p><a href="https://chrisenns.com/recommendations/"><img src="https://chrisenns.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/Faraway-So-Close1.jpg" alt="" title="Make Me Rich" width="334" height="113" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2166" /></a></p>
<p>In the interest of full disclosure some of the links (i.e. <a href="https://www.dreamhost.com/r.cgi?63222">Dreamhost</a>) give me a kickback for recommending them, but I only recommend stuff I am either currently using or have used in the past.</p>
<p>Have any questions about the services I'm recommending?  Leave a comment here or <a href="mailto:chris.enns@gmail.com">send me an email</a> and I'll do my best to answer your question.</p>

<p>As I said <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/iChris/status/15630835029905408">last night on Twitter</a>, that Word Lens app is bonkers. Crazy-go-nuts bonkers.</p>

<p>Assuming it's legit and does what it says, that is amazing. The app itself is free and then you buy the languages you want to translate for $5/each. (Each way that is.  English to Spanish is $5, Spanish to English is $5.)</p>

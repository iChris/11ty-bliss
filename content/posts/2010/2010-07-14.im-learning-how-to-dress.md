<p>The site (and corresponding <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewPodcast?id=338552753">podcast</a>) is called <a href="https://putthison.com">Put This On</a>.  It's teaching me how to dress myself.  I'm just going to quote <a href="https://putthison.com/post/811624289/start-by-simplifying">this post</a> in it's entirety:</p>
<blockquote><p>Do you want to know how to start looking better?  Simplify.</p>
<p>Stop wearing clothes with logos, prints and crazy details.</p>
<p>Instead, focus on great basics.  When I say basics, I mean basics.  White t-shirt.  Blue dress shirt.  White oxford.  Blue jeans.  Gray wool pants.  Khaki chinos.  Blue blazer.  Gray suit.  Great boots.  Basic shoes.  Focus on blue, white, gray.  Buy good clothes that fit.</p>
<p>Minimalize.</p>
<p>It’s OK for your clothes to be a simple frame for what’s important: <strong>you</strong>.</p></blockquote>

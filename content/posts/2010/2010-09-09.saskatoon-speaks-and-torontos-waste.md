title: "Saskatoon Speaks and Toronto&#039;s Waste"

<p>In sharp contrast to the corporate blah blah of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qry_r4OkDrg">this video</a> from the freshly launched <a href="https://www.saskatoonspeaks.com/">Saskatoon Speaks.com</a> site is this video from the City of Toronto's e-waste program:</p>
<p><object width="400" height="250"><param name="movie" value="https://www.youtube.com/v/Y8Es9tWXZgw?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US&amp;rel=0"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="https://www.youtube.com/v/Y8Es9tWXZgw?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US&amp;rel=0" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="400" height="250"></embed></object></p>
<p>I love the idea/purpose behind <a href="https://www.saskatoonspeaks.com/">Saskatoon Speaks.com</a>, just not the promo video that probably cost $5-$10k to produce.  Why bother producing a video that, aside from the images, could be talking about any other city in North America?  Seems like a missed opportunity for an otherwise great campaign.</p>

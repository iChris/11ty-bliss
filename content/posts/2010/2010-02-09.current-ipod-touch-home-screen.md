<p>This <a href="https://chrisenns.com/2008/07/17/current-ipod-touch-screen-layout/">post is consistently among my top requested</a> posts so I figured I might as well update it to current apps:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lemon/4343681507/" class="tt-flickr tt-flickr-Medium" title="Current iPod touch Screen (2010-02-09)"><img class="alignnone" src="https://farm3.static.flickr.com/2705/4343681507_5a4b676696.jpg" alt="Current iPod touch Screen (2010-02-09)" width="320" height="480" /></a></p>
<p>I'm embarrassed to show you that Foursquare and Facebook are on there, but otherwise I'm proud to show off the apps I use most often.</p>
<p>Any that you're using that you don't see there and why?</p>

title: "If You See the Computer They Blew It"
---
<blockquote><p>
  The difference is, of course, I can put the phone in my pocket the second you start talking to me. It is not part of our conversation and there is no screen alerting me to a new message or enticing me with some video. Putting the phone in my pocket is a way to say, “Okay it’s just you and me talking now.” But wearing that computer on your face is a reminder that, well, you have a damn computer on your face.

<p>As a tech geek I'm intrigued by <a href="https://www.google.com/glass/start/">Google Glass</a>. But having seen how little self control most people have with their smartphones - <em>turn off notifications, put it away when you're in a conversation, your 5 year old doesn't need an iPhone</em> - I can't imagine handing over this level of distraction to the average person.</p>
<p>Think of that annoying person who's texting, tweeting or Instagram'ing constantly while you're sitting together at a coffee shop. Now imagine that they're doing all that on a pair of glasses so it kind of looks like they're talking to you but completely not.</p>
<blockquote><p>
  What? Oh sorry. No I was talking to my glasses. What were you saying?
</p></blockquote>
<p>When this is more widely available, it'll really test the old saying that you wouldn't punch a person wearing glasses.</p>

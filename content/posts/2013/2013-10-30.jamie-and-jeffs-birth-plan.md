title: "Jamie and Jeff''s Birth Plan"

<p>I'd quote <a href="https://www.mcsweeneys.net/articles/jamie-and-jeffs-birth-plan">the whole thing</a> but I'm laughing too hard:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  While we do not have a traditional “philosophy” of “childbirth,” we have been heavily influenced by orthodox Wholefoodism and the “(d)well baby/good design” movement. We believe strongly in the power of the female body and a long-term night nurse. We are opposed to torture/gluten. In the event you are ever unsure how to proceed today, please ask yourself, “What Would Gwyneth Do?”

<blockquote><p>
  Please don’t put the baby on a scale, as we don’t want her to have the same body image issues as her fat mom.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Anti-vaccination.</p>
<blockquote><p>
  We will not be vaccinating our baby. Please vaccinate all other babies on this floor.
</p></blockquote>

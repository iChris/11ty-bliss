title: "What It's Really Like to Work with Steve Jobs"

<blockquote><p>
  I can still remember some of those early meetings, with 3 or 4 of us in a locked room somewhere on Apple campus, with a lot of whiteboards, talking about what iMovie should be (and should not be). It was as pure as pure gets, in terms of building software. Steve would draw a quick vision on the whiteboard, we'd go work on it for a while, bring it back, find out the ways in which it sucked, and we'd iterate, again and again and again. That's how it always went. Iteration. It's the key to design, really. Just keep improving it until you have to ship it.

<p>Read the <a href="https://inventor-labs.com/blog/2011/10/12/what-its-really-like-working-with-steve-jobs.html">full article for more great stories about working with Steve Jobs</a>.</p>
<p>I like that these kinds of stories slowly trickle out. That some folks, seemingly the ones closest to Steve Jobs, take time to process and think about what's worth sharing and what they want to keep personal.</p>

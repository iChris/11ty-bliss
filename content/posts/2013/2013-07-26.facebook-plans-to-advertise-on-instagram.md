title: "Facebook Plans to Advertise on Instagram"
---
<p>Hopefully surprising no one, <a href="https://thenextweb.com/facebook/2013/07/24/zuckerberg-facebook-will-generate-a-lot-of-profit-from-instagram-ads-will-come-when-the-time-is-right/">Facebook plans to put ads in once the platform is big enough</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “Kevin [Systrom] has always been clear that we’re building Instagram to be a business,” Zuckerberg said. “We expect over time to generate a lot of profit from it. We think the right focus for now is to continue increasing the footprint of Instagram and, when the right time comes, we’ll think about advertising.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>When they do this, they should also offer a $5/year pro plan to not see ads. And that's it. Just a little button that takes $5 from your Facebook widget bank account thing <sup id="fnref-21561:1"><a href="#fn-21561:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> a year so you don't have to see ads.</p>
<p>I'm not saying every internet thing has to charge money to be successful. Just give folks an option to pay you and not default to ads as the only way.</p>

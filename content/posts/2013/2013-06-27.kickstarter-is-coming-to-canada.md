title: "Kickstarter is Coming to Canada"
---
<p>Opening up later this summer. <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/canada">Sign up now to be notified</a>.</p>
<p>It'll be interesting to see what payment processor they work with. In the US Kickstarter uses Amazon to handle all the verifying and credit card processing. I'm hoping for <a href="https://stripe.com/ca">Stripe</a> but maybe they've worked out all the details with Amazon Canada.</p>

title: "Flash Security Issue - How to Uninstall Flash on OS X"
---
<p>After seeing <a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2013/02/adobe-issues-emergency-flash-update-for-attacks-on-windows-mac-users/">this alert about vulnerabilities in Flash</a>, I'm finally getting rid of Flash on my MacBook Air.</p>
<p><a href="https://helpx.adobe.com/flash-player/kb/uninstall-flash-player-mac-os.html#main_10_4">Here's Adobe's instructions on how to uninstall Flash player from your Mac</a> or you can <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2010/11/flash_free_and_cheating_with_google_chrome">follow John Gruber's method of removing Flash</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/browser/">Google Chrome</a> works as a stand-alone Flash player but most of the popular services (i.e. YouTube, Vimeo, etc.) offer HTML5 based players.</p>
<p>From my afternoon of usage without Flash installed, any site that pops up with a missing Flash player error so far has been because an ad wanted to play. So - not missing much. The only issue I'll have is needing to find a better player for the <a href="https://www.ssktn.com/live/">live feed at SSKTN.com</a>.</p>

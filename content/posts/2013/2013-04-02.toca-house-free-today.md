  Toca House is a free play toy for kids that takes them through the everyday chores of a household. Cleaning, washing windows, delivering mail, taking a bath or mopping the floor. These are all familiar themes for kids that they see every day, but often can’t participate in. But now they can – and it’s fun too!

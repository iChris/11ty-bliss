title: "Survive and Thrive in Minecraft"
---
<p>As my son and I fall deeper into the Minecraft hole, we came across a great set of videos on YouTube by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/paulsoaresjr">paulsoaresjr</a>, particularly his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL7326EF82122776A9">Survive and Thrive series</a> which gives a good overview of playing Minecraft.</p>
<p>What's great about his videos is that they're family friendly. So many of the Minecraft videos we've tried to watch end up being a group of kids swearing at each other and making racist comments - it is the internet after all.</p>
<h3>Example Video</h3>
<p>You can <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?list=SP7326EF82122776A9&feature=player_detailpage&v=AUYRnD7PzWI#t=456s" target="_blank">click here to jump to the more interesting part of the video where he starts actually building his house</a>, or watch the whole thing below.</p>

<h3>Money in Minecraft</h3>
<p>As of this post, he's got almost 670,000 subscribers to his YouTube channel and that particular video has almost 900,000 plays.</p>
<p>I don't know what rate he's on with YouTube but using videos I've uploaded as a rough guide, let's say YouTube pays out around $0.005 (half a penny) per view. A video with 900,000 plays would give him $4,500. Not bad for 20 minutes worth of video.</p>
<p>But that's just one video in that particular series of 80, as of this posting, videos. One video in that series has <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B36Ehzf2cxE&amp;list=SP7326EF82122776A9&amp;index=1">nearly 3.5 million views</a> or approx. $17,500 using my very rough calculations.</p>
<p>On average a video in the series ends up around 450,000 views - give or take. So 80 videos x 450,000 = 36,000,000 views x $0.005 = $180,000. Again, very rough and guestimatey math here.</p>
<h3>Can You Make a Living on YouTube with Minecraft Videos?</h3>
<p>The first <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B36Ehzf2cxE&amp;list=SP7326EF82122776A9&amp;index=1">video in the series</a> was posted, if the data is correct, sometime in January, 2012. So $180,000 over the last 19 months isn't bad work if you can get it.</p>
<p>Except that's just that one series.</p>
<p>His <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEbtIY4p_ltr9s1Yg3fUHZgQB_5T9fRp6">Paul Plays Minecraft series</a> has 43 videos with an average of 240,000 views. Using the same numbers as above, that's another $51,000.</p>
<p>He's got a whole ton of other videos - over 1,400 as of this post - and a lot of them have under 1,000 views. And I don't know what rate he's actually being paid by YouTube for the ads playing before his videos. Could be less than the $0.005 I'm guessing - but likely it's more.</p>
<h3>Awesome</h3>
<p>It's interesting times when someone can make money showing others how to do stuff in a video game - but how much different is it than somebody trying to make money showing others how to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Avu76lmur6s">use apps on their Mac</a>? And Paul does an amazing job of keeping the videos entertaining for both me and my 6yr old son.</p>
<p>Plus he gets to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeQ7TOL8ScQ">play with his sons</a> which is all kinds of awesome.</p>

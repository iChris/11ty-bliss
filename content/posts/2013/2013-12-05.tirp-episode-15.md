title: "TIRP Episode 15"
---
<p>One of our better episodes if I say so myself. Which I just did.</p>
<blockquote><p>
  All three amigos are back in the SSKTN studios. We follow up on Adam’s 13″ vs 15″ debate, his smoke alarm battery, and we have a group therapy session on getting projects out the virtual door. In the words of mudmonster from the chat room – “the best TIRP yet.”

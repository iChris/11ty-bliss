title: "Reeder 2 for iOS"
---
<p>I've been using <a href="https://cloud.feedly.com/">Feedly</a> and have been fine with it's <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/ca/app/feedly-your-google-reader/id396069556?mt=8&amp;uo=4&amp;at=10l4Ki">free iOS app</a> but I do miss the design and functionality of Reeder and when I have $4.99 in my app budget jar again, I'll be <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/ca/app/reeder-2/id697846300?mt=8&amp;uo=4&amp;at=10l4Ki">picking up a copy in the App Store</a>. It works for both iPhone and iPad.</p>
<p>If it's good enough for <a href="https://shawnblanc.net/2013/09/the-new-reeder-for-ios/">Shawn Blanc</a>, it's good enough for me.</p>

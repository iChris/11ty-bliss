title: "So You Wanna Be a Mac Consultant"
---
<p>Patrick Rhone has a great <a href="https://patrickrhone.com/2013/04/14/so-you-wanna-be-a-mac-consultant-now/">write up on what it takes to be a Mac consultant in 2013</a> - including his thoughts on how much to charge and how much patience you need (hint: a lot).</p>
<p>His most important bit of advice is something applicable for anyone doing any sort of tech support:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Also, be upfront about what you donâ€™t know but still be willing to help them get help.
</p></blockquote>
<p>A big part of the reason I couldn't stand working in tech support is there's always someone else out there willing to lie and give out an opinion as if it's fact.</p>
<p>Nothing that a <a href="https://chrisenns.com/g/leftcross.gif">left cross</a> wouldn't fix.</p>

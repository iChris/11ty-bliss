<p>Scott Johnson, of <a href="https://frogpants.com">Frog Pants Studios</a>, is a dad who lets his 12 year old son teach him about <a href="https://minecraft.net">Minecraft</a>.</p>

<p>I showed Damien, my 5 year old son, <a href="https://minecraft.net">Minecraft</a> for all of 10 minutes and his eyes lit up and his brain started running with questions.</p>

<p>I'm not sure if it's ever happened but <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/ca/app/instapaper/id288545208?mt=8&amp;uo=4&amp;at=10l4Ki">Instapaper is currently free in the App Store</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Instapaper is the simplest way to save and store articles for reading: offline, on-the-go, anytime, anywhere, perfectly formatted.

<p>On a <a href="https://www.ssktn.com/tirp/15/">recent episode of The Intellectual Radio Program</a>, Adam, Tim and I debated Instapaper vs <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/ca/app/pocket-formerly-read-it-later/id309601447?mt=8&amp;uo=4&amp;at=10l4Ki">Pocket</a> (which is always free). I still stand by Instapaper as my go to read it later app of choice, and especially now that it's on sale for the low price of free.</p>

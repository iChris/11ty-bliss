title: "App.net Offers a Free Plan"

<p>Commonly called freemium:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  a business model by which a product or service (typically a digital offering such as software, media, games or web services) is provided free of charge, but a premium is charged for advanced features, functionality, or virtual goods. <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freemium">Wikipedia entry on freemium</a></em>
</p></blockquote>
<p>From the <a href="https://blog.app.net/2013/02/25/introducing-a-free-tier/">blog post at ADN HQ</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Although App.net has had only paid account tiers thus far, we initially conceived of App.net as a freemium service. It took some time to get to this point, but we are now ready to make this vision a reality.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Free accounts are limited in the following ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Free tier accounts can follow a maximum of 40 users.</li>
<li>Free tier accounts have 500 MB of available file storage.</li>
<li>Free tier accounts can upload a file with a maximum size of 10 MB.</li>
</ul>

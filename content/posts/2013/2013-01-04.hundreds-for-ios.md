  To win: tap &amp; grow floating bubbles until they add to 100. There's just one catch: They turn red when touched. And if a bubble collides when red, you're dead.</p>
<p>  Simple in concept, deep in design, Hundreds explores emergent puzzles that combine the minimal with the strategic by introducing a multitude of objects over the course of 100 unique puzzles. For ages 2 to 222.

title: "Marco Arment Sells a Majority Stake in Instapaper"
---
<p>Given the success of <a href="https://the-magazine.org">The Magazine</a>, hard not to see this happening soon. From <a href="https://www.marco.org/2013/04/25/instapaper-next-generation">the post on Marco's blog</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  I’m happy to announce that I’ve sold a majority stake in Instapaper to <a href="https://betaworks.com/">Betaworks</a>. We’ve structured the deal with Instapaper’s health and longevity as the top priority, with incentives to keep it going well into the future. I will continue advising the project indefinitely, while Betaworks will take over its operations, expand its staff, and develop it further.

<p>I was actually thinking about where Instapaper was headed a little while ago and recently had tried out <a href="https://getpocket.com">Pocket</a>, which is an Instapaper competitor/clone. I really like Instapaper but it has felt like the iOS app (<a href="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=528&GR_URL=https%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fus%252Fapp%252Finstapaper%252Fid288545208%253Fmt%253D8%2526uo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30" target="itunes_store">Instapaper in the App Store</a>) hasn't seen the design love that something like The Magazine has gotten.</p>
<p>I'll keep using Instapaper until there's something about it that either pushes me away or a feature in another app that draws me in. For now I don't feel like there's any reason to change and I trust Marco's judgement in who he has sold Instapaper to that they won't destroy what he's built any time soon.</p>

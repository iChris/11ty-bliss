---
<p>Time once again for the <a href="https://deals.macupdate.com/affil/11916">MacUpdate bundle</a>. 10 apps for $49.</p>
<p>The main attraction for most people is getting Parallels Desktop 8 for $49 when it retails for $79 normally. Parallels allows you to install and run Windows (or Linux) operating systems on your Mac.</p>
<p>Some of the other apps included in <a href="https://deals.macupdate.com/affil/11916">the MacUpdate bundle</a> include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>DEVONthink Pro 2</strong>: Could be an interesting program to organize documents around a project. </li>
<li><strong>Prizmo 2</strong>: Scanning and OCR'ing software which would probably work well with DEVONthink</li>
<li><strong>238 OpenType Fonts</strong>: Who doesn't want more fonts?</li>
<li><strong>iStat Menus 4</strong>: System monitoring application for your Mac. Most people probably could care less but nerds like details like this.</li>
<li><strong>PhotoStyler 6</strong>: Instagram your photos.</li>
<li><strong>DiskAid 6</strong>: Gives you file level access to all the data on your iOS device of choice.</li>
</ul>

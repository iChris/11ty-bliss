title: "Guitar Teacher 2.0"
---
<p>Anthony Stauffer, <a href="https://steviesnacks.com">guitar teach to the masses over at StevieSnacks.com</a>, has started a new blog called <a href="https://guitarteacher20.com">Guitar Teacher 2.0</a> where he's planning to share his story of "running an accidentally successful business."</p>
<blockquote><p>
  In 2007 I started putting free guitar lessons on YouTube. In January 2008 I began selling longer videos. In 2009 I left my job to keep. Today StevieSnacks has been my fulltime job for over 3 years.</p>
<p>  This blog is the place where I write about the day-to-day work and decisions involved with running an accidentally successful business.</p>
<p>  My work at StevieSnacks is complicated, tedious and extremely nerdy. Sometimes when I have a nerd victory, I need to share it with someone.

<p>In an attempt to spur on adoption of AppDotNet (<em>or ADN for short</em>), <a href="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?grid=9646&id=6PFrOqNV4B8&offerid=162397&type=3&subid=0&tmpid=3664&RD_PARM1=https%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fca%252Fartist%252Ftapbots%252Fid293642940%253Fuo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30" target="itunes_store">Tapbots (iTunes App Store link)</a> have made their ADN clients free for a limited time.</p>
<p>So even if you're not sure if you're ever going to use ADN, I'd recommend grabbing the apps so you have them on your Apple account. They're normally $9.99 I believe:</p>

<p>If you'd like to give ADN a whirl, I have 3 one month trial accounts that I can give out. No credit card required and you get a month of full ADN to experiment with. Leave a comment with your email address below if you're interested.</p>

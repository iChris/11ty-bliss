title: "Minecraft over Disney"

<p>As if on cue, this post on Medium, <a href="https://medium.com/editors-picks/57a0128b53c9">Choosing Minecraft over Disney</a>, was sent my way shortly after publishing the <a href="https://chrisenns.com/2013/05/a-kid-teaches-his-dad-minecraft/">previous post</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  But even the cursing Minecrafters are better than pre-tween-targeted sitcoms on Disney or Nickelodeon. Let my sweet impressionable kid spend a day with China on AntFarm or Alex on Wizards of Waverly Place and my parental battles erupt. Bad language is easy to curb, but stupid adult stereotypes, sarcasm, backstabbing behavior, and contempt are not.</p>
<p>  I wish this wasn’t true, because I love all of the Disney movies, and appreciate the recent releases with strong female characters, but I have yet to see an episode of any tween sitcom (as I’ll call them) in which the adults are not morons and the dialogue between the young characters is not caustic.

<p>To give an idea of the scale of this game for those readers for whom Minecraft is a foreign idea and looks kind of stupid, the people on Twitter she talks about in her article that her daughter watches have <a href="https://twitter.com/SkyDoesMinecraf">170,000+</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/iHasCupquake">110,000+</a> followers on Twitter. SkyDoesMinecraf has 3.2 million subscribers on his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/SkyDoesMinecraft">YouTube channel</a> and his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5YWep6NMQM">most popular video</a> as of this post is around 8.4 million views.</p>
<p>Crazy huh?</p>

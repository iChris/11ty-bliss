<p>Drafts for iOS (<a href="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=528&GR_URL=https%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fus%252Fapp%252Fdrafts%252Fid502385074%253Fmt%253D8%2526uo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30" target="itunes_store">Drafts for iPhone $2.99</a>, <a href="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=528&GR_URL=https%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fus%252Fapp%252Fdrafts-for-ipad%252Fid542797283%253Fmt%253D8%2526uo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30" target="itunes_store">Drafts for iPad $3.99</a>) is like most great apps that look so simple that's almost perplexing how you might use it but then you come across one little tip or trick and all of a sudden the app just opens up to you.</p>

<p><em>Maybe that's just me?</em></p>
<p>Reading through <a href="https://georgecoghill.wordpress.com/2013/03/07/advanced-tips-for-drafts-app/">Advanced Tips for Drafts App</a> my brain hurts a bit trying to figure out how I might use Drafts. The idea of appending notes to a text file in Dropbox is awesome and confusing at the same time.</p>
<p>So my simple use for Drafts right now is to post a tweet without having to actually log in to Twitter.</p>
<p>Why would I want to do that?</p>
<p>Well if I load up <a href="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=528&GR_URL=https%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fus%252Fartist%252Ftapbots%252Fid293642940%253Fuo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30" target="itunes_store">Tweetbot</a> then I see the stream of tweets that I haven't read since I last looked, plus any replies or mentions I might have gotten as well. Not that I'm <strong>so</strong> popular that I have a lot of either, but it still pulls me in to keep up.</p>
<p>Here's how it works with Drafts in a few screenshots.</p>

<p>Like I said at the beginning, I've barely scratched the surface of how I could be using Drafts. I'm beginning to use it to send tasks and thoughts to Omnifocus, also to send entries to Day One but I often forget and just end up using the apps directly. Which is fine - except that on my iPhone 4 Drafts starts up much quicker than either of those two apps.</p>
<p>Have you used Drafts yet? I'm curious how you've integrated it into your workflow.</p>

<p>Great promo video for the new Breaking News site, as well as a <a href="https://lonelysandwich.com/post/66004181119/theres-only-one-movie-poster-at-the-sandwich">great back story on the video's production by Adam Lisagor</a>.</p>
<p>I can't wait for the inevitable wikipedia entry that links all of the <a href="https://sandwichvideo.com">Sandwich Video productions</a> together in one long story arc.</p>

title: "Marco on Our Digital Lockdown"

<p>Marco Arment <a href="https://www.marco.org/2013/07/03/lockdown">writes a great call to arms for developers and nerds alike in the wake of Google Reader's shutdown</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  We need to keep pushing forward without them, and do what we’ve always done before: route around the obstructions and maintain what’s great about the web. Keep building and supporting new tools, technologies, and platforms to empower independence, interoperability, and web property ownership.
</p></blockquote>
<p>It's exciting times but the march towards silo'd platforms like Facebook, Google+, etc. doesn't bode well for the future. It's not enough for Google &amp; Facebook to offer a data export tool - <a href="https://www.google.com/takeout/">Google has a pretty good one in Takeout</a> - but the interoperability of web apps is what keeps things interesting.</p>
<p>Flickr allows you to share your photos elsewhere - admittedly still keeping a link back to Flickr. But you don't see a Share button on Facebook that will send your video you upload there to YouTube or Vimeo.</p>

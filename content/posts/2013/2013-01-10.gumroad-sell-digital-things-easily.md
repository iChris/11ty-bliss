title: "Gumroad - Sell Digital Things Easily"
---
<p>I came across <a href="https://gumroad.com">Gumroad</a> via a <a href="https://twitter.com/elliotjaystocks/status/289326331672526848">tweet by Elliot Jay Stocks</a> and was intrigued by the service. It offers the ability to quickly and easily sell digital (and physical) things. So a song, an ebook, tutorial video, podcast, Photoshop template, WordPress theme, etc. anything that you can package up as a file Gumroad can sell for you as long as it's less than 4GB.</p>
<p>For a quick test I listed a recently published (and <a href="https://www.ssktn.com/podcasts/lostandlemon/041-lost-lemon-getting-fresh-with-freshbooks/">freely available</a> I might add so probably not worth actually buying unless you really want to support <a href="https://ssktn.com">SSKTN</a>) episode of the <a href="https://www.ssktn.com/shows/lostandlemon/">Lost &amp; Lemon podcast</a> I do with my brother in law.</p>

<h3>Quick Review</h3>
<p>I really like how quickly and easily I could list something for sale. Services like this that take all the friction out of selling a product are great because it enables anyone who's creative to put their <em>stuff</em> out there without much effort - aside from all the effort of creating whatever it is.</p>
<p>For me I could see using it to sell special one-off audio files (i.e. a tutorial or review), a training video or an ebook. There's other services out there that you could use - <a href="https://www.tinypass.com">Tinypass</a> is another one I've come across recently - but <a href="https://gumroad.com">Gumroad</a> seems to be the quickest from signing up to listing your masterpiece that I've come across.</p>

<p>I saw this <a href="https://twitter.com/lorenb/status/306837063192412160">via Loren Brichter on Twitter</a>. Billed as "The new era of touch spreadsheets. Starting on iPad.", <a href="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=528&GR_URL=https%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fus%252Fapp%252Fpermanent-new-spreadsheet%252Fid602402480%253Fmt%253D8%2526uo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30" target="itunes_store">Permanent (App Store link, currently 50% for launch at $9.99)</a> looks like an interesting app to pick up if you're doing a lot of spreadsheeting. Spreadsheets? Number crunching on your iPad.</p>

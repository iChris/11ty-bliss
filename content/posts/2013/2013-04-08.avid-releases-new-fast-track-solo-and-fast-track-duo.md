title: "Avid Releases New Fast Track Solo and Fast Track Duo"
---
<p>Avid recently updated a bunch of hardware and software (<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2013/04/08/avid-announces-media-composer-7-and-pro-tools-11-ios-compatible-recording-hardware/">see this post on Macrumors.com for full details</a>) but the one point I found interesting is that the new versions of their <a href="https://www.avid.com/US/products/fasttrack-solo">Fast Track Solo</a> and <a href="https://www.avid.com/US/products/fasttrack-duo">Fast Track Duo</a> include the ability to plug into iPad 2 or newer or iPad minis.</p>

<p>I have an older Fast Track series audio device and they work great as portable recording studios for podcasting or music production. Paired with GarageBand for iOS (<a href="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=528&GR_URL=https%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fus%252Fapp%252Fgarageband%252Fid408709785%253Fmt%253D8%2526uo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30" target="itunes_store">$4.99 in the App Store</a>) it's crazy how powerful a recording studio you could have in your backpack.</p>

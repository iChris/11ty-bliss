<p>Speaking of Drafts, <a href="https://5by5.tv/b2w/113">on the most recent episode of Back to Work</a> Merlin covers a lot of ground on why you might want to check out Drafts for iOS (<a href="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=528&GR_URL=https%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fus%252Fapp%252Fdrafts%252Fid502385074%253Fmt%253D8%2526uo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30" target="itunes_store">Drafts for iPhone $2.99</a>, <a href="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=528&GR_URL=https%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fus%252Fapp%252Fdrafts-for-ipad%252Fid542797283%253Fmt%253D8%2526uo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30" target="itunes_store">Drafts for iPad $3.99</a>)</p>
<p>Like I said <a href="https://chrisenns.com/2013/04/drafts-for-iphone/">in my earlier post</a>, I'm still finding my way with Drafts but a lot of what Merlin said helps me know I'm at least on the right track with attempting to use Drafts in my workflow on my iPhone.</p>

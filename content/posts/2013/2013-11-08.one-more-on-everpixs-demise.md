<p>From an article titled <a href="https://subimage.com/blog/2013/11/07/everpix-snapchat-and-the-startup-lie/#.Un0EZpEw-lJ">Everpix, Snapchat and The Startup Lie</a>:</p>

  See, most venture capitalists swing for the fences — all the time. They don’t care about base hits, doubles, and sometimes even home runs. They want the grand slam, the big idea, The Next Facebook.</p>

<p>Worth reading down into the comments where one of the Everpix founders responds.</p>
<p><strong>Worth checking out</strong>: <a href="https://picturelife.com">Picturelife</a> seems to do what Everpix did, only they're actually charging real money for the service. I'm gun shy right now but might give it a shot to see how it compares.</p>

title: "Yahoo''s Big Week"

<p>First, Yahoo <a href="https://marissamayr.tumblr.com/post/50902274591/im-delighted-to-announce-that-weve-reached-an">announced that they've reached an agreement to purchase Tumblr</a>. Marissa Mayer, CEO of Yahoo:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  We promise not to screw it up.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Yahoo has had a bit of a history with screwing up purchases like this - having purchased Geocities back in the day for around a billion dollars as well and then never doing anything with it until they killed it.</p>
<p>And then Flickr, which Yahoo owns, <a href="https://blog.flickr.net/en/2013/05/20/a-better-brighter-flickr/">announced a redesign and new plans for the photo sharing service</a> including a free terabyte of storage for every account:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Weâ€™re giving your photos room to breathe, and you the space to upload a dizzying number of photos and videos, for free. Just how big is a terabyte? Well, you could take a photo every hour for forty years without filling one.
</p></blockquote>
<p>It's kind of like way back when <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gmail">Google offered a free gigabyte with Gmail</a> - 1 terabyte is so much space right now that it's hard to imagine ever needing it.</p>

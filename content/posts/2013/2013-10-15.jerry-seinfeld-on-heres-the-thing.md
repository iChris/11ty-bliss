title: "Jerry Seinfeld on Here's the Thing"

<p>Alec Baldwin and Jerry Sienfeld have <a href="https://www.wnyc.org/story/jerry-seinfeld/">a great conversation ranging from the TV show, Jackie Mason, Mad Men and Manhattan</a>.</p>
<p>And for a bonus, Alec Baldwin drops a Saskatchewan reference:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  When you lived where we lived, that was Saskatchewan.

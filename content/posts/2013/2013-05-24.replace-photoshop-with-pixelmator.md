title: "Replace Photoshop with Pixelmator"
---
<p>When I've posted about Pixelmator in the past (<a href="https://chrisenns.com/2013/05/pixelmator-update/">here</a>, <a href="https://chrisenns.com/2012/11/pixelmator-on-for-half-price/">here</a>, and <a href="https://chrisenns.com/recommends/mac-apps/">here</a>) I've gotten the question of "Can you replace Photoshop with Pixelmator" and I keep meaning to write up my thoughts - which I still haven't done.</p>
<p>But while you're waiting you can read a <a href="https://tidbits.com/article/13775">better response by Michael Cohen over at TidBITS</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  The answer to that, I’m afraid, may disappoint those who want cut-and-dried answers to complex questions: it depends on how you use Photoshop, and what you use it for. In my case, and in the cases of other members of the TidBITS staff whom I asked, the answer seems to be “Yes.”

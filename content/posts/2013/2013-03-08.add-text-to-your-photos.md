<p>You'll either annoy or delight those who follow you on Instagram/etc. by putting artsy typography over top of your shots of coffee cups, skies with clouds and fields of snow with <a href="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=528&GR_URL=https%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fus%252Fapp%252Fover%252Fid535811906%253Fmt%253D8%2526uo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30" target="itunes_store">Over ($1.99 in the App Store)</a>.</p>

<p>If you use <a href="https://evernote.com">Evernote</a> to track and store stuff or you've heard about it and are thinking of starting to use it, you should pick up a copy of Brett Kelly's eBook titled <a href="https://members.nerdgap.com/order-evernote-essentials/">Evernote Essentials for $29USD</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  <strong>Evernote’s problem</strong>: it’s a blank canvas, an empty sheet of paper. You download it, fire it up and… now what? There are so many possibilities, it’s hard to get started. And once you do, it’s hard to know how to organize your Evernote data.</p>
<p>  <strong>Your problem</strong>: you’ve heard the hype and you want to get started with this earth-shattering product, but you don’t want to spend hours upon weekends learning not only how to use it, but the best ways to use it.

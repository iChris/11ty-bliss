title: "RØDE iXY Stereo Mic for iPad and iPhone"
---
<p>RODE <sup id="fnref-21098:1"><a href="#fn-21098:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> has released a new mic for iPad and iPhone users called the <a href="https://www.ixymic.com">iXY</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  At the heart of the iXY is a matched pair of ½” cardioid condenser capsules, fixed in a perfect 90 degree ‘near-coincident’ alignment. This results in immersive and true-to-life stereo recordings, captured in incredibly high detail.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Great idea for reporters, podcasters or anyone doing any sort of audio work. I have their <a href="https://www.rodemic.com/mics/videomic">VideoMic</a> that I use for recording interviews and it works great.</p>

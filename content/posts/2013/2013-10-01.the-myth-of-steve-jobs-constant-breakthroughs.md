title: "The Myth of Steve Jobs’ Constant Breakthroughs"
---
<p>The next time you hear some dummy say something like "Apple just doesn't innovate like they did with Steve Jobs", slap them upside the head and then give them <a href="https://techland.time.com/2013/09/24/the-myth-of-steve-jobs-constant-breakthroughs/">this article by Harry McCracken to check out on their Blackberry</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Last Friday, Apple’s iPhone 5s and iPhone 5c went on sale. The company <a href="https://www.apple.com/pr/library/2013/09/23First-Weekend-iPhone-Sales-Top-Nine-Million-Sets-New-Record.html">sold nine million of them in the first weekend</a>, breaking the five-million-phone record it set last year with the iPhone 5. I sort of thought that was clearly good news for Apple and the iPhone. Or at least not, you know, worrisome news.</p>
<p>  Then I read <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/blogs/business/2013/09/why-record-iphone-sales-might-be-rotten-for-apple-aapl/">a piece by Sandy Cannold at ABCNews.com</a> (which I found via <a href="https://parislemon.com/post/62090967848/first-weekend-iphone-sales-top-nine-million">MG Siegler’s ParisLemon</a>). Cannold says that the new iPhones selling so well and generating so much hoopla is potentially alarming.

<p>Skeptics will always be skeptics. And the narrative that Apple is doomed to failure is just too juicy to pass up for many journalists and armchair technology pundits - but at least base your story in fact and not twisting everything around to fit your narrow view of how the tech world should work.</p>
<p>Jobs has "...a total of six industry-changing items, or one every 860 days on average, though the gap was sometimes substantially longer."</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Now, that’s a remarkable streak. But it’s not a revolution every other year. And Tim Cook has been CEO of Apple for only a little over two years, so there’s nothing deeply troubling about the fact that he hasn’t boiled any oceans yet.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Every single thing Apple releases will be trumpeted by Apple fans as the greatest thing since the iPod and pointed to as the downfall of Apple by the doomsday crowd.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Apple keeps working at its products. Incrementally making them better with each new release.</p>

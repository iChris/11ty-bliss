<p>This time it's a category of Apps called "Utilize" and features more great apps to help you be a bit more productive. Or at least spend more time on the idea of being productive.</p>
<p>Here's the apps I'd recommend or am familiar with that are 50% off:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=528&GR_URL=https%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fus%252Fapp%252F1password-password-manager%252Fid443987910%253Fmt%253D12%2526uo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30" target="itunes_store">1Password (on sale for $24.99)</a> Use <strong>something</strong> besides 'password123' for your passwords. Something so simple as your email account password can unlock everything you do online. </li>
<li><a href="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=528&GR_URL=https%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fus%252Fapp%252Ffantastical%252Fid435003921%253Fmt%253D12%2526uo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30" target="itunes_store">Fantastical (on sale for $9.99)</a> is a great menu bar replacement for the built in Calendar app on OS X. The great thing about how your data is stored on OS X is that you can use multiple apps and they all access the same central data. </li>
<li><a href="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=528&GR_URL=https%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fus%252Fapp%252Fpopclip%252Fid445189367%253Fmt%253D12%2526uo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30" target="itunes_store">PopClip (on sale for $2.99)</a> gives you iOS style pop-over links to copy/paste. I had tried the beta and really liked the idea - I suspect Apple will eventually build something like this into OS X.</li>
<li><a href="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=528&GR_URL=https%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fus%252Fapp%252Fsoulver%252Fid413965349%253Fmt%253D12%2526uo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30" target="itunes_store">Soulver (on sale for $12.99)</a> - a calculator app that functions like a piece of paper with a built in calculator. I'm not as tempted by the Mac App as I am by the <a href="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=528&GR_URL=https%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fus%252Fapp%252Fsoulver-notepad-calculator%252Fid348142037%253Fmt%253D8%2526uo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30" target="itunes_store">iPhone ($2.99 in the App Store)</a> or <a href="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=528&GR_URL=https%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fus%252Fapp%252Fsoulver-for-ipad%252Fid371982536%253Fmt%253D8%2526uo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30" target="itunes_store">iPad ($4.99 in the App Store)</a> versions, but could be good to have in on your Mac if you do a lot of calculations there.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/ca/collection/utilize/id29520?fcId=595822532&amp;mt=12">view the rest of the applications on sale here</a> and let me know in the comments below or <a href="https://twitter.com/ichris">on Twitter</a> which apps you like from the sale list and if I've missed one in my feature list above that should be there.</p>

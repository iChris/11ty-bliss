title: "Don't Run a Sh*tty Company"

<p>Interesting discussion on last week's <a href="https://5by5.tv/quit/14">Quit!, episode 14</a> talking about Yahoo's decision to no longer allow people to remotely work.</p>
<p>I loved this quote from the discussion:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Yahoo is an internet company thatâ€™s scared of the internet.
</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="https://david.heinemeierhansson.com">David Heinemeier Hansson</a> was a guest on this episode and he offers some fresh, honest <sup id="fnref-21223:1"><a href="#fn-21223:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> advice on building a new "thing" and running a modern company. David is a partner at <a href="https://37signals.com">37signals</a>, creators of Basecamp, Highrise and Campfire.</p>
<p>It's an interesting time and it's certainly not for every business - but you have to believe that in a few (5? 10?) years we'll look back on how people all used to have to go to a physical office and wonder why we lived that way?</p>
<p>I'm not saying every business will be that way, nor will we all live in little digital holes in our basement. But if you just think of the amount of time our society spends driving to and from work - hours a day - and imagine what could be done with that time<sup id="fnref-21223:2"><a href="#fn-21223:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>?</p>

title: "The Coming War Over Advertisers"

<p>Matt Drance on Facebook's invasion of Google's <a href="https://www.appleoutsider.com/2013/04/05/home-turf/">Home Turf</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  I think we’ll know well before the end of this year how Facebook Home affects handset sales. If buyers start asking “does it have Facebook Home?” — and I think many will — that will be bad news for both Google and Apple. However, the Google – Facebook war is sure to be more vicious than the Google – Apple war because Google and Facebook have the same customers: advertisers. Users are their currency, and Facebook is about to rob the bank.

<p>An interesting thought because Apple could stand to come out ok in all of this since they're not dependant on advertisers - Apple depends on users. Apple is happy to advertise on Google and Facebook because they need to sell real, physical things to users - not sell user's data to advertisers.</p>

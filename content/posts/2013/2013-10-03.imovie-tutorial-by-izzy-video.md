title: "iMovie Tutorial by Izzy Video"
---
<p>I've had a lot of people come up to me lately and ask if I know of any good iMovie training or tutorials and besides just doing a YouTube search, I hadn't come across anything.</p>
<p>Then today I saw that Izzy of Izzy Video put out a <a href="https://www.izzyvideo.com/imovie-tutorial/">free tutorial series on iMovie so now I can send people there.</a></p>
<p>It includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>more than 2 hours of video training.</li>
<li>This tutorial is totally free to watch on his site!</li>
<li>(Optional) You can purchase the sample media to use as you follow along with the course if you choose (This includes a downloadable version of the course video as well.)</li>
</ul>
<p>I know from watching many of his Final Cut Express/Pro tutorial videos over the years that Izzy does a such a great job producing these training videos. He's certainly one of the main inspirations for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/lemonproductionsca">my own screencasts and tutorials</a>.</p>

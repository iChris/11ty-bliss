title: "Survivor: Caramoan Starts February 13th"
---
<p>My wife and I remain fans of the reality TV show Survivor <sup id="fnref-21123:1"><a href="#fn-21123:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> and with the next season of the show they're returning to the fans versus favourites formula in <a href="https://www.cbs.com/shows/survivor/photos/1000079/survivor-caramoan-cast/33836">Survivor: Caramoan</a>.</p>
<p>Love it or hate it, this will be the 26th season of a television show that many picked to be gone awhile ago.</p>
<p>If you're more of a Survivor fan than I am, you could start watching anyone of the many other Survivor spinoffs from around the world as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survivor_(TV_series)">listed on the Survivor Wikipedia page</a>.</p>

<p>I use Instacast on my iPhone to listen to podcasts (<a href="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=528&GR_URL=https%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fus%252Fapp%252Finstacast-3%252Fid577056377%253Fmt%253D8%2526uo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30" target="itunes_store">Instacast 3 in the App Store</a>) and as nice as it is to have podcasts on the go, I spend a good portion of my day at my laptop playing a podcast on my iPhone which sits on my desk. Not a big deal but it does use my iPhone's battery while playing and so I often end up having my iPhone plugged in and charging.</p>
<p>Or as <a href="https://512pixels.net/2013/05/instacast-mac-beta/">Stephen Hackett put it</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Finally, our long national nightmare of listening to our iPhones at our desks is coming to an end.

<p>The Instacast for Mac beta is <a href="https://vemedio.com/products/instacast-mac">now available to try out</a> and I'm excited to give it a spin.</p>

<p>I've been hanging on to Instacast 2 on my iPhone but it looks like I might finally have to take the plunge and upgrade to get Instacast Cloud support for syncing of playlists and podcasts between the Mac and iOS.</p>

title: "Griffin Twenty Audio Amp for AirPort Express"
---
<p>When I talk to people about the Airplay, AppleTV and AirPort Express setup I use at our house (<a href="https://chrisenns.com/2011/11/airplay-with-apple-tv-and-airport-express/">see this post for more details</a>), I often get asked about a set of speakers people have from an old stereo/amp and up until now you always had to have a big, clunky amplifier to hook up and power those speakers.</p>
<p>I just saw <a href="https://www.tuaw.com/2013/02/28/griffin-twenty-audio-amp-airplay-for-your-big-old-college-speak/">this post on TUAW.com</a> about Griffin's new Twenty Audio Amplifier that integrates with an Airport Express:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Wouldn't it be nice if you could grab those humongous speakers that you bought back in college and somehow hook them up to an AirPlay-enabled amp? That's the idea behind the <a href="https://www.griffintechnology.com/twenty">Griffin Twenty Audio Amplifier</a> (US$99.99), which uses your existing speakers and an old AirPort Express (not included) to let you stream music to your towers of power.

<p>So for $99 you can <a href="https://www.apple.com/ca/airportexpress/">buy an AirPort Express</a>, add another $99 for the <a href="https://www.griffintechnology.com/twenty">Griffin Twenty Audio Amplifier</a> and connect your old speakers and you've got a sweet wireless stereo.</p>

<p>I promise I'm not going to keep linking to everything Anthony writes, but <a href="https://guitarteacher20.com/blog/2013/4/9/the-day-dan-benjamin-made-me-cry">this one is definitely worth it</a>:</p>

  It wasnâ€™t until that moment that I realized how heavy StevieSnacks had become. For 4 years I had been doing nearly everything myself. Nobody could help me, it all was all on my shoulders. If I stopped, the business stopped. I had been carrying around the weight of an warehouse of ideas with no relief in sight.

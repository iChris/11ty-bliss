title: "The Intellectual Radio Program Debuts"
---
<p>I'm pumped to announce the new show I've launched with myself, Adam Clark and Tim Smith called <a href="https://www.ssktn.com/tirp/">The Intellectual Radio Program</a> - tongue firmly placed in cheek obviously.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ssktn.com/tirp/"><img src="https://chrisenns.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Intellectual-Radio-Program-600x600.png" alt="Intellectual-Radio-Program" width="600" height="600" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-21571" /></a></p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.ssktn.com/tirp/1/">episode 1 of the show titled "Punch You in the Targaryens"</a>, we talk about Time Warner pulling a CBS blackout and then reversing their decision, Netflix setting up viewer accounts within a family, and Marco Arment’s post about what having internet fame gets you in terms of sales in the App Store.</p>
<p>We spend the last half of the show talking through episodes 1 and 2 of Game of Thrones, season 1. Plenty of spoilers abound so you’ve been warned.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ssktn.com/tirp/1/">Take a listen</a> and then be sure to <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/ca/podcast/intellectual-radio-program/id682246844">subscribe in iTunes and leave a rating or review while you're there</a> - it helps us get the show out to more people if we get a review. Especially the 5 star reviews.</p>

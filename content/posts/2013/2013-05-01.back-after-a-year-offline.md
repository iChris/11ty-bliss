title: "Back After a Year Offline"
---
<p>Paul Miller took a year off of the internet. Completely off. Not just deactivated his Facebook account. And The Verge paid him to stay offline and write about it. He's just turned his connection back on and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/5/1/4279674/im-still-here-back-online-after-a-year-without-the-internet">written about his experience</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  It's hard to say exactly what changed. I guess those first months felt so good because I felt the absence of the pressures of the internet. My freedom felt tangible. But when I stopped seeing my life in the context of "I don't use the internet," the offline existence became mundane, and the worst sides of myself began to emerge.

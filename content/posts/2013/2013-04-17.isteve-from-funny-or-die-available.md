title: "iSteve From Funny or Die Available"

<p><a href="https://www.funnyordie.com/videos/d2e0f617e3/isteve">Available for streaming on Funny or Die is iSteve</a>, their movie about the life of Steve Jobs. I've only watched the first 8 minutes or so and I'm not sure if it's attempting to be funny and poke fun or a homage from fans - or some combination of the two.</p>
<p>Bookmarked for viewing later.</p>

title: "OpenFrame - A Simple Way to Display Prints and Photos"

<blockquote><p>
  If you're like us, we have dozens of posters that are just lying around in tubes or drawers. They never made it onto the wall because we never got around to framing them. Custom framing can be expensive and is limited to holding one size of print. We designed OpenFrame as a simple, flexible way to hang posters, prints, and photos of various sizes and configurations.

<p>I really love the idea of <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/openframe/openframe-a-simple-flexible-way-to-display-prints-0">OpenFrame on KickStarter</a>. It seems so simple and yet works so well. I also like how the rewards for projects like this are easy - support as much as you want relative to how many frames you want. No gimmicks.</p>

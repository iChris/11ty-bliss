title: "Mac Pro Loaded Up, Pre Apple Event"
---
<p>I haven't done one of these in awhile <sup id="fnref-21715:1"><a href="#fn-21715:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> but on the eve of the Mac Pro as we know it possibly disappearing, here's what the most expensive Mac (non-server) you can order from Apple is looking like <sup id="fnref-21715:2"><a href="#fn-21715:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>:</p>
<h2>Mac Pro</h2>
<ul>
<li>Two 3.06GHz 6-Core Intel Xeon (12 cores)</li>
<li>64GB (8x8GB)</li>
<li>512GB solid-state drive</li>
<li>512GB solid-state drive</li>
<li>512GB solid-state drive</li>
<li>2TB 7200-rpm Serial ATA 3Gb/s hard drive (<strong>Might as well have one big drive for back up/storage</strong>)</li>
<li>ATI Radeon HD 5870 1GB</li>
<li>One 18x SuperDrive</li>
<li>Apple LED Cinema Display (27" flat panel)</li>
<li>Apple LED Cinema Display (27" flat panel)</li>
<li>Magic Mouse</li>
<li>Apple Keyboard with Numeric Keypad</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Price before tax</strong> - $12,917.00. Applecare for $279 would be a no-brainer if you're buying all that.</p>
<p>Now how about the iMac?</p>
<h2>iMac</h2>
<ul>
<li>3.5GHz Quad-core Intel Core i7, Turbo Boost up to 3.9GHz</li>
<li>32GB 1600MHz DDR3 SDRAM - 4X8GB</li>
<li>1TB Flash Storage</li>
<li>Apple USB SuperDrive</li>
<li>NVIDIA GeForce GTX 780M 4GB GDDR5</li>
<li>Apple Magic Mouse</li>
<li>Apple Wireless Keyboard (English) &amp; User's Guide</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Price before tax</strong> - $4,088.00.</p>
<p>We'll see how this looks by tomorrow afternoon after the Apple event. If the Mac Pro gets a final release date and new cinema (<em>cough</em> retina <em>cough</em>) displays get released, I suspect the $12k price point could actually go higher and not lower for the latest, greatest Mac.</p>

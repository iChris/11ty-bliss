title: "Scaling Your Career"

<p>I'd highly recommend watching <a href="https://vimeo.com/55825725">Marco Arment's talk</a> from last year's <a href="https://çingleton.com/en/">Çingleton conference</a> on scaling your career.</p>

<p>I can certainly identify times in my own career where I've been sitting around waiting for someone to hand me authority. And I can also remember times where I just stood up and took that authority, whether I really believed I was capable of doing it or not. I certainly regret the former and haven't ever regretted the later.</p>
<p>Thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/smorr">Scott Morrison</a>, owner of <a href="https://www.indev.ca">Indev Software</a> and newly transplanted Saskatoon resident, for reminding me about the 2012 (and 2011) videos <a href="https://vimeo.com/cingleton">available on Vimeo</a>. They've got great talks from really smart folks in the Apple community viewable for free if you're interested in that kind of thing.</p>

<p>I write in Markdown on this blog. I use it when I record notes for <a href="https://ssktn.com">podcasts I record</a> and when I'm taking notes in <a href="https://lemonproductions.ca">conversations for my day job</a>. It's so quick to write when you work in a web/real world hybrid like I do.</p>
<p>There's the <a href="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=528&GR_URL=https%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fus%252Fbook%252Fmarkdown%252Fid622433972%253Fmt%253D11%2526uo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30" target="itunes_store">version in the iBookstore</a> and there's also <a href="https://macsparky.fetchapp.com/sell/liexohbo">a PDF version available if you're not a iOS user</a>.</p>

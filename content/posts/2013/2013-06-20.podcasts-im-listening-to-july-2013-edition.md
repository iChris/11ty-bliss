<ul>

<li><a href="https://nonbreakingspace.tv/daniel-ryan/">Daniel Ryan on The Non-Breaking Space Show</a> - Daniel Ryan was the Director of Front-End Development for President Obama's 2012 election campaign and he talks in great detail about the tech they used for getting donations and encouraging people to vote. If you're not involved in web/tech the discussion gets a bit deep in the stack at times but there's some great stuff in there for anybody who's thinking about using the web to market or reach out to a group of people. Creepy awesome.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.ssktn.com/smym/chris-enns-ssktn/">Chris Enns on Show Me Your Mic</a> - Podcasting vanity! Linking to your own show that features yourself. I had <a href="https://timothybsmith.com">Tim Smith</a> join me to turn the mic around and ask me questions about what I use to produce podcasts at <a href="https://www.ssktn.com">SSKTN</a> and the workflows I use to get shows out on the web. If podcasting about podcasting interests you, then this is a great episode to listen to.</li>

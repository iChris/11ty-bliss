title: "Picking a Filter is So Stressful"

<p>Days is an interesting looking visual (<em>think photos and animated GIFs</em>) diary app for iOS (<a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/days-your-visual-photo-gif/id630768365?ls=1&amp;mt=8">free in the App Store</a>) that makes me throw up in my mouth when they throw in marketing garbage like this on their <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/days-your-visual-photo-gif/id630768365?ls=1&amp;mt=8">App Store listing</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  There’s no filters or camera roll import, so you can be you—in less time and without all the stress.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Really? Adding a filter or having to import a photo from your camera roll is <strong>so</strong> stressful? I'm all for minimalism and simplifying but the hyperbole goes over the top.</p>
<p>And apparently it's not simple enough for one App Store reviewer:</p>

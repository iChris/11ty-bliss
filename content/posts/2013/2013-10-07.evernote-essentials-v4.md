<p>For a limited time you can get Brett Kelly's excellent (and recently updated) book Evernote Essentials for half off - only $14.99 <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/ca/book/evernote-essentials/id709838195?mt=11&amp;uo=4&amp;at=10l4Ki">in the iBooks Store</a> or <a href="https://members.nerdgap.com/evernote-essentials/buy/">in other formats directly from Brett</a>.</p>
<p>I'm still on the fence on how much I want to use <a href="https://www.evernote.com">Evernote</a>, but if you're at all into using Evernote this is a recommended book to pick up and learn more about a great app.</p>

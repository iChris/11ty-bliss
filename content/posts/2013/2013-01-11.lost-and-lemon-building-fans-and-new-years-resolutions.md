title: "Lost and Lemon - Building Fans and New Years Resolutions"

<p>I'm really happy with how the most recent episode of the Lost &amp; Lemon podcast I record with my brother-in-law turned out - <a href="https://www.ssktn.com/podcasts/lostandlemon/043-lost-lemon-building-fans-and-new-years-resolutions/">listen or download here</a> / <a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/stat?id=HGf4R7IezFs&amp;offerid=146261&amp;type=3&amp;subid=0&amp;tmpid=1826&amp;RD_PARM1=http%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fca%252Fpodcast%252F%252Fid467564174%253Fuo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30">subscribe in iTunes here</a> - unplanned as usual but we found our way onto a topic that's been at the back of my brain for the last few weeks: this is the year that I either push <a href="https://ssktn.com">SSKTN</a> up the hill to being a proper <em>thing</em> or I pull back a bit and it just remains a little hobby.</p>
<p><strong>SPOILER ALERT</strong></p>
<p>Not to ruin the episode, but I want to grow SSKTN this year. Barring extenuating life circumstances, I want to be able to say in 10 - 12 months whether it can be a <em>thing</em> I do.</p>
<p>More to come.</p>

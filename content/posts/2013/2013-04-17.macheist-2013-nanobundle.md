<p>MacHeist's NanoBundle for 2013 includes some great apps for $9.99:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://macheist.com/#xscope">xScope</a> is for developer/designers who need pixel measurements.</li>
<li><a href="https://macheist.com/#istopmotion">iStopMotion</a> is an app to record and create stop motion videos.</li>
<li><a href="https://macheist.com/#totals">Totals</a> I'm not familiar with but it's an invoicing app.</li>
<li><a href="https://macheist.com/#clarify">Clarify</a> is an app to more easily send screenshots and instructions.</li>
<li><a href="https://macheist.com/#cleanmymac2">CLean My Mac</a> does what it sounds like.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://macheist.com/#pathfinder">Path Finder</a> and <a href="https://macheist.com/#littleinferno">Little Inferno</a> are unlocked once a certain number of sales have been reached - which they always do.</p>
<p><a href="https://macheist.com/#fantastical">Fantastical</a> is the app that I'm most interested in picking up. I just don't do enough calendar/event scheduling that it makes it worth it to me. And the places I do a lot of scheduling for, namely <a href="https://ssktn.com">SSKTN</a>, I do it in Basecamp so Fantastical doesn't help there.</p>
<p>Totalled up the apps would cost $250 if you bought them all. Just about all the apps included are more than $9.99 on their own so even if, like me, you're after just one it's still worth it to pick up the bundle.</p>
<p>Will you be buying the 2013 MacHeist Bundle?</p>

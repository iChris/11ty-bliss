<p><a href="https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/markdown-on-save-improved">It</a> went from being a "why would I ever use that?" to "I can't run a website without it" in the shortest time of any plugin I've used on WordPress.</p>
<blockquote><p>
  The plugin hadn’t been updated in an embarrassingly long time, but I finally got around to fixing some bugs around mobile publishing and updating the included Markdown Extra library to the latest version. It won’t go without updates so long again.

<p>Markdown on Save Improved (or MOSI as I prefer to call it when I never say it out loud) is developed by <a href="https://wp.mattwie.be/2013/01/19/markdown-on-save-improved-2-3-released/">Matt Wiebe</a>.</p>

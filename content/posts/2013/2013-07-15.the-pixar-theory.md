title: "The Pixar Theory"
---
<p>As seen on <a href="https://512pixels.net/2013/07/negroni-pixar/">512pixels.net</a>: a theory that all the films from Pixar fit into one world timeline. <a href="https://jonnegroni.com/2013/07/11/the-pixar-theory/">Read it when you have a few minutes</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Every movie is connected and implies major events that influence every single movie. Here we go. Brave is the first and last movie in the timeline. Obviously, this movie about a Scottish kingdom during the Dark Ages is the earliest time period covered by the Pixar films, but itâ€™s also the only Pixar movie that actually explains why animals in the Pixar universe behave like humans sometimes.

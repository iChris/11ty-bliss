---
<p>A bunch of apps are free this week to celebrate the 5th Anniversary of the App Store. Check out <a href="https://toolsandtoys.net/great-free-apps-io/">the full list at Tools and Toys</a> but these are some of my recommendations to grab that I've used:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=528&GR_URL=https%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fus%252Fapp%252Fday-one-journal-diary%252Fid421706526%253Fmt%253D8%2526uo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30" target="itunes_store">Day One for iPhone and iPad</a> is a journaling app that is a great way to record thoughts, ideas, journals. I use it primarily as a photo journal by choosing a picture from my iPhone's camera roll and then adding a few thoughts about the moment, event or day the picture was from. Day One allows you to export a PDF, email or print and share your journals with friends. It's the one journal that I've kept at longer than any other.</li>

title: "2013 GM Traverse Review"
---
<p>Earlier this summer my family got the opportunity to take a 2013 GM Traverse out for a trip to British Columbia. Travelling two provinces over with 3 kids is not anyone's idea of a great time so we jumped at the chance to have a newer vehicle to make the trip a little more exciting with.</p>
<h3>Packed to the Brim</h3>

<p>We got off to a bit of a rocky start. With 3 kids under 6 and one still in a playpen/car seat/high chair you've got a lot of stuff to pack when you're travelling for a week. Even with our minivan we're jammed pretty tightly so stepping down in overall cargo space to an SUV was going to be tough.</p>
<p>In the end we managed to get everything in but we were pretty close to calling it off and going back to our minivan. <sup id="fnref-21724:1"><a href="#fn-21724:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> But the idea of taking a new vehicle and with some nudging from some friends we decided to go for it with the Traverse. <sup id="fnref-21724:2"><a href="#fn-21724:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup></p>
<h3>Life is a Highway</h3>

<p>On the highways and byways to Dawson Creek, BC. the Traverse drove great. During the longer stretches when the cries of "how much longer" grew the loudest we put on a movie and our two oldest loved that they got their own wireless headphones to put on and listen with. My wife and I loved that we didn't have to listen to Crazy Frog or whatever video we had played on the DVD player for them.</p>
<p>Comfortable driver and passenger seats made the long hours on the road very do able.</p>
<h3>Sights and Sounds</h3>
<p>Hooking up my iPhone to the GM Traverse's sound system worked really well. Connecting via Bluetooth or using the built-in iPhone cable connection port both worked well. And like I said above, with the kids having their own sound and headphones we could have something entirely different playing in the front.</p>
<h3>Traversing with a Traverse</h3>
<p>The comfortable ride of the Traverse combined with the media options for the kids (and adults) made a long trip go really well.</p>
<p>Next time we'll try it  when there's snow flying and get to see how the Traverse handles the mountain roads when they're slick and icy.</p>

Truth be told we flopped back and forth a couple of times. Car seats were moved. Playpens rearranged. Luggage got kicked.&#160;<a href="#fnref-21724:1" rev="footnote">&#8617;</a>

A word of caution to those with 3 younger kids here. We were packing for a week-long trip but weren't camping - we had bedding where we were going and only had to bring minimal food along. If we'd been packing for a camping trip there's no way we could have fit it all in.&#160;<a href="#fnref-21724:2" rev="footnote">&#8617;</a>

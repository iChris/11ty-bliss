<p>Podcast Monday? Is that a thing? Maybe I'll make it a thing.</p>
<p>At any rate. Here's some podcast episodes I've enjoyed recently that may do good things to your eardrums:</p>
<h3>Any Color But Purple, The New Disruptors</h3>
<ul>

</ul>
<p>Glenn Fleishman, writer for <a href="https://www.economist.com">The Economist</a> and executive editor of <a href="https://www.economist.com">The Magazine</a> interviews <a href="https://twitter.com/Coudal">Jim Coudal</a> of <a href="https://www.coudal.com/about.php">Coudal Partners</a> and have a great discussion about <a href="https://decknetwork.net/">The Deck Network</a>, an online advertising network, <a href="https://fieldnotesbrand.com/">Field Notes</a> and in general the business of running a creative business in 2013. I'm tempted to just loop it in my office for the next while to let things soak in.</p>
<h3>John Gruber, The Big Web Show</h3>
<ul>

</ul>
<p>Jeffrey Zeldman interviews John Gruber of <a href="https://daringfireball.net">Daring Fireball</a> about how he got his start, why investors don't like Apple and where he got the name for his blog. As a long time reader of Daring Fireball and follower of <a href="https://twitter.com/gruber">@gruber</a> on Twitter, I enjoyed the look behind the blog that Zeldman got out of Gruber in this podcast.</p>
<h3>A 'Full-Time' Masterclass with Shawn Blanc, CMD+SPACE</h3>
<ul>

<p>Shawn Blanc, of <a href="https://shawnblanc.net/">ShawnBlanc.net</a> and <a href="https://www.ssktn.com/podcasts/welcometotheinternet/019-welcome-to-the-internet-shawn-blanc/">my guest on Welcome to the Internet awhile back</a>, has a great chat with host Myke Hurley about taking a side business full-time and answering some great listener/reader questions along the way.</p>

<p>That's what's been in my ears lately. How about you?</p>

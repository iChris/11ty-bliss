title: "What You Can Learn From My Plumber"
---
<p>From my new favourite website, <a href="https://putthingsoff.com">Put Things Off</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>My plumber has an excellent business card. It says "Phil Jones" on the top line. Underneath that is his job title: "Plumber". It's great because it tells me everything I need to know about what he does. He doesn't try to dress up his line of work by calling himself a "Strategic Pipeline Analyst" or an "Aqueous Substance Manager". He does what it says on the tin. Your job title should do the same.</p></blockquote>
<p>The above quote is from an article entitled "<a href="https://putthingsoff.com/articles/job-title-blacklist/">The Job Title Blacklist for the Self-Employed</a>"  but it could really apply to anyone in any size of business.  Does your job title accurately reflect what it is you do?</p>

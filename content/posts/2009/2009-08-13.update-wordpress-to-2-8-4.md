title: "Update WordPress to 2.8.4"

<p>If you're on a self-hosted WordPress blog and you see a message looking something like this at the top of your login page:</p>
<p><img src="https://chrisenns.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/updatewordpress1.png" alt="updatewordpress" title="updatewordpress" width="313" height="38" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1747" /></p>
<p>You should probably click it.  You'll then see a screen that looks something like this:</p>
<p><img src="https://chrisenns.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/areyousureupdatewp1.png" alt="areyousureupdatewp" title="areyousureupdatewp" width="589" height="93" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1748" /></p>
<p>Where you should click '<strong>Upgrade Automatically</strong>' and then sit back and watch the magic happen.</p>
<p>A few words of caution.  If you're not sure if your WordPress blog has some sort of auto-backup of the database, don't click those buttons I told you to click above.  My current favorite is the plugin <a href="https://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-db-backup/">WP-DB Backup</a> which allows you to email yourself (remember that Gmail account you have with gigs of space you're not using?) a copy of your database on a weekly basis.  Just to be safe.</p>

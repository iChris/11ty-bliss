title: "The Weather&#039;s Here, Wish You Were Beautiful"

<p>I've got time for a short update as we pop in on a free wireless access point to quickly check on work stuff we left behind.  It's beautiful here in Jasper in spite of the cooler than we had hoped temperatures.  Lots of hiking around, taking a tram up to the top of a mountain, getting snowed on, enjoying our cozy cabin with an awesome fireplace (exactly the kind of fireplace we want if we ever build a house).  A few pics below and we're off again.</p>

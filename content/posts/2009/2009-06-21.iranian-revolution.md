<p>From a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/21/opinion/21tehran.html?_r=1">New York Times piece by Roger Cohen</a> who is in Iran reporting:</p>
<blockquote><p>I also know that Iran’s women stand in the vanguard. For days now, I’ve seen them urging less courageous men on. I’ve seen them get beaten and return to the fray. “Why are you sitting there?” one shouted at a couple of men perched on the sidewalk on Saturday. “Get up! Get up!”</p></blockquote>
<p>Worth a read to understand the tension and turmoil going on in our world.</p>

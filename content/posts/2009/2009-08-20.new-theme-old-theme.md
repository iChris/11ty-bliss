title: "New Theme / Old Theme?"

<p>If you happened by the site on Thursday night, you may have noticed some weirdness happening.  I'm playing around a bit with the theme/color as I do <a href="https://dewade.blogspot.com/2008/01/einhundert.html">every other week</a>.  I'm curious as to what you, the reader, thinks?  Hit up the poll at the bottom of this post to vote!</p>

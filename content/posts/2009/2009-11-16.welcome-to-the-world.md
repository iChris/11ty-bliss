<p>My sister, Andrea, had a baby girl yesterday morning:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lemon/4109325179/" class="tt-flickr tt-flickr-Medium" title="BeerBaby Giving the Middle Finger"><img class="alignnone" src="https://farm3.static.flickr.com/2790/4109325179_b1547044b4.jpg" alt="BeerBaby Giving the Middle Finger" width="334" height="500" /></a></p>
<p>As of yet, she goes un-named.  For now, we only know her as 'BeerBaby.'</p>
<p>Because her parent's last name is Beer.  What were you thinking?</p>

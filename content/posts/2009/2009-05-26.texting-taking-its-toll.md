title: "Texting Taking It&#039;s Toll"
---
<p>According to a recent <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/26/health/26teen.html?_r=1">article in the New York Times</a>, texting is becoming a bit of an issue among teens.</p>
<p>I, for one, am shocked.  I had no idea that we as a society would unleash a new technology without having any sort of boundaries or training for it's potential users or thought given to it's impact until well after the fact.</p>
<blockquote><p>Texting may also be taking a toll on teenagersâ€™ thumbs. Annie Wagner, 15, a ninth-grade honor student in Bethesda, Md., used to text on her tiny LG phone as fast as she typed on a regular keyboard. A few months ago, she noticed a painful cramping in her thumbs. (Lately, she has been using the iPhone she got for her 15th birthday, and she says texting is slower and less painful.)</p></blockquote>
<p>Ahh.  Good to see that an Apple product once again saves the day.</p>

title: "Preach it, Preacher"
---
<p>My wife got the opportunity to preach a sermon a week and a bit over ago.  You can go <a href="https://www.forestgrovecc.com/sermons.html">find it on the site here</a>.  Unfortunately I can't link to her talk directly due to the site being in flash - hopefully you can find your way.  It was on 08/23/2009 and she spoke about the Parable of the Rich Fool.  I think she did awesome, but I may be a bit biased.</p>
<p>Even if you're not the sermon listening to type, it's worth listening to for the random voice overs that were recorded when Sue mentioned a few local stores in her sermon.</p>
<blockquote><p>When I go to visit <strong>Store Name A <em>(in a male voice)</em></strong></p></blockquote>

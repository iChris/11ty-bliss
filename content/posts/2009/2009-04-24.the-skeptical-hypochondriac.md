<p>A blog about health, that's actually a _blog_ about health:</p>
<blockquote><p>My qualifications to cover health, social and psychological trends include years of childhood therapy (I’m proud to say never gave an inch and wet the bed right through it all); a doctor who responded to a Thanksgiving call from me about some concerning chest pains by saying he could squeeze me in sometime around the third week of January; and about three hundred hours in a steam bath with old Jews who often complained that I seemed to kvetch too much. Trust me, I’m your man.</p></blockquote>

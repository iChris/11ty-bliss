title: "The Movie Industry Must Die"
---
<p>A woman using a pocket video camera to tape footage of her sister's birthday party at a movie theatre was thrown in jail for 2 nights.</p>
<blockquote><p>The movie industry has turned into an alcoholic dad who beats up his family at the slightest transgression while ignoring his own gross failures -- blaming everything on external forces and refusing to confront its own problems.</p></blockquote>
<p>Awesome.</p>

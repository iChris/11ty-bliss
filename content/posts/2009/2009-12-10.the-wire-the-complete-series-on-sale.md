<p>The best show you'll never watch is <a href="https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B001FA1P1W?ie=UTF8&tag=farawsoclos0a-20&linkCode=as2&camp=15121&creative=390961&creativeASIN=B001FA1P1W">on sale for $149 (regularly $249) at Amazon.ca</a>  <em>Disclosure:  Click that link and buy something and Amazon sends me a couple nickels.</em> It's got it's fair share of violence, swearing, etc. so it's definitely not for everyone.</p>
<p>For a taste check out <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmIvu1yg3bU">Season 01 opening scene and title</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cvq3Pf3j61c">'McNuggets'</a>.  <strong>Warning:</strong> Salty language ahead.</p>

<p>From a reviewer on Amazon:</p>
<blockquote><p>THE WIRE has been called Dickensian, and there is truth to the comparison. This is a great American novel, highlighting the sad state of the inner city and the scarred souls who inhabit it.</p></blockquote>

<p>An interesting chat to observe between two "celebrities" who are trying to use their celebrity to push for positive change in the world.</p>
<p>You can appreciate a bit more of how Bono is able to get stuff done for AIDS relief by the stares he gives George Clooney in this interview.  You'd be hard pressed to say no to someone staring you down like that.</p>

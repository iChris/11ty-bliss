<p>If you're a fan of music, or if you have some sort of soul, or you love hearing an Irish lad talk about lost love, or you appreciate a lyric that has a bit more thought put into it then the average fluff on the radio these days...</p>
<p>Or if you really liked the movie '<a href="https://us.imdb.com/title/tt0907657/">Once</a>' or just the song 'Falling Slowly' from that movie's soundtrack...</p>
<p>If any of those things are true, then I suggest you check out <a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/stat?id=6PFrOqNV4B8&offerid=146261&type=3&subid=0&tmpid=1826&RD_PARM1=http%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fca%252Falbum%252Fstrict-joy-deluxe-edition%252Fid334528009%253Fuo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30" target="itunes_store">Strict Joy (Deluxe Edition) - The Swell Season</a> (iTunes link).</p>
<p>Plus, the dude can <strong>sing</strong>.  Sing in such a way that if I wasn't happily married with a child I'd seriously consider gay-marrying him.</p>

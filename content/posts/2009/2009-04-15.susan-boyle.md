<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lp0IWv8QZY">Susan Boyle sings for Britain's Got Talent</a></p>
<p>Brutally good (and appropriate) lyrics as well:</p>
<blockquote><p>I dreamed a dream in time gone by<br />
When hope was high<br />
And life worth living<br />
I dreamed that love would never die<br />
I dreamed that God would be forgiving.</p>
<p>Then I was young and unafraid<br />
And dreams were made and used<br />
And wasted<br />
There was no ransom to be paid<br />
No song unsung<br />
No wine untasted.</p>
<p>But the tigers come at night<br />
With their voices soft as thunder<br />
As they tear your hope apart<br />
As they turn your dream to shame.</p>
<p>And still<br />
I dream he'll come to me<br />
That we will live the years together<br />
But there are dreams that cannot be<br />
And there are storms<br />
We cannot weather...</p>
<p>I had a dream my life would be<br />
So different from this hell I'm living<br />
so different now from what it seemed<br />
Now life has killed<br />
The dream I dreamed.</p></blockquote>

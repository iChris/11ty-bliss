<p>Some friends and I are blogging the happenings over at <a href="https://honkindoodle.com">HonkinDoodle.com</a>.  It's a domain I've been sitting on for awhile and have never known what to do with.  I'm not sure this is <em>the right</em> thing to do, but it's something to do.  Got to start somewhere.</p>
<p><a href="https://honkindoodle.com">HonkinDoodle.com</a> is basically a multi-author blog where, at present, we're just posting stuff that interests us and for whatever reason doesn't fit the flow of our personal sites/blogs.  Maybe I'm grasping at something that doesn't need to exist anymore, but I'm hoping that there's still some interest in what's going on besides what you see on your friend's Facebook pages.</p>
<p>Interested in helping us blog the internet?  <a href="mailto:chris.enns@gmail.com">Drop me a line</a> and I'll hook you up with a login.  It's a very prestigious thing to have.  T shirts are coming next!</p>

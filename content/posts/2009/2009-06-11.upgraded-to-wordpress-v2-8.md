title: "Upgraded to Wordpress v2.8"
---
<p>I've upgraded this blog to <a href="https://wordpress.org/development/2009/06/wordpress-28/">Wordpress v2.8</a>, let me know if you see anything funky.</p>
<blockquote><p>I’m very excited to announce to everyone that the latest and greatest version of WordPress, version 2.8 “Baker,” <a href="https://wordpress.org/download/">is immediately available for download</a>. 2.8 represents a nice fit and finish release for WordPress with improvements to themes, widgets, taxonomies, and overall speed. We also fixed over 790 bugs. This release is named in honor of noted trumpeter and vocalist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chet_Baker">Chet Baker</a>.</p></blockquote>
<p>Here's a video explaining what's new:</p>

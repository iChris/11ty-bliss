title: "I Hate My Voice"
---
<p>Or in other words, here's my first podcast that I'm involved with - in front of the mic as it were:</p>
<p><a href="https://u2log.lemonproductions.ca/2009/04/episode-001-inauguration-day/">U2log.com audio podcast episode 001</a></p>
<p>I'm joined by <a href="https://christopherschmitt.com/">Christopher Schmitt</a>, a fellow contributer to <a href="https://www.u2log.com">u2log.com</a> (<em>and <a href="https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/0735712638?ie=UTF8&tag=farawsoclos0a-20&linkCode=as2&camp=15121&creative=390961&creativeASIN=0735712638">published author/web design guru</a></em>), and we discuss U2 related stuff.  Listen to me "yeah" and "ugh" along with Christopher.  It's not for everyone but I know that I had fun recording it as well as editing it together and figuring out the whole podcasting recording/setup/etc.  I'll post my workflow somewhere if anyone is interested.  (<em><a href="https://www.ambrosiasw.com/utilities/wiretap/">Wiretap Studio</a> was a great thing to get as part of the <a href="https://www.macheist.com/">Macheist</a> bundle</em>)</p>
<p>As I mentioned, I hate the sound of my voice.</p>

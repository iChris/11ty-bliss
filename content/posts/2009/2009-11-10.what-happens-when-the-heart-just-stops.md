title: "What Happens When the Heart Just Stops?"

<p>I can't promise this will be the last thing I post about them, but I'm such a sucker for the wailing pain of a heart broken.</p>

<blockquote><p>So what happens when the heart just stops<br />
Stops caring for anyone<br />
The hollow in your chest dries up<br />
And you stop believing</p>
<p>So what happens when the heart gives up<br />
But the body goes on living<br />
The blood crawls to a slow and stops<br />
And flows away</p>
<p>Well we got no-one to meet<br />
No love we would beseech<br />
We only have ourselves to blame for everything<br />
The was no answer in the dust<br />
And I'm missing you so much<br />
And now you're sleeping<br />
And I'm leaving</p>
<p>Empty-handed waiting<br />
Time it will subside and we'll agree<br />
It was a given<br />
Well there was no standard we could set<br />
And the world it does regret<br />
To have to leave you in this state of bereavement</p>
<p>You see I'm feeling everything<br />
Nothing gets by</p>
<p>There is a hollow in my chest<br />
The time I won't forget<br />
There is no comfort in the eyes<br />
They put us always to the test<br />
I can't prepare myself for that<br />
But I work it out in time<br />
There is a love that flows between us<br />
Ever-changing everyday<br />
I worked myself up to a crawl<br />
But I'm not fearing it at all<br />
We have no reason left to stay<br />
And that's why we're leaving<br />
And there was no answer in the dust<br />
And the one I feared to trust<br />
There is a lie that drags us<br />
Beating and pulling into disappointment</p>
<p>I'm disappointed</p></blockquote>

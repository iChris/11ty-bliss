<p>I'm sure to those folk "in the know" with this type of music it's old news, but I've listening to Dub FX most of the morning here at work:</p>

<p>I don't normally dig this kind of music but you got to have respect for someone creating that from scratch. Harmonizing with yourself is hard enough for most folks in the studio, let alone doing it live and keeping all the tracks running with your feet.</p>
<p>If you're so inclined you can go <a href="https://dubfx.bandcamp.com/">buy some of his music on his bandcamp.com site</a>.</p>

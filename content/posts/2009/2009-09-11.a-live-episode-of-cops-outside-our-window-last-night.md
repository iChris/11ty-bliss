title: "A Live Episode of Cops Outside Our Window Last Night"

<p>We got home late last night after a visit with the fam and as we were going to bed I noticed what seemed to be flashing lights outside our window.  Here's the play by play from my twitter account last night:</p>

<p>Thanks iPod touch for not correcting my spelling on that one.  I'm pretty sure I meant to say 'important' and not impotant.  Or impotent.</p>
<p>I was in <strong>no way</strong> implying that possible drug dealers who were arrested outside my house are impotent.</p>
<p>Please don't hurt us.</p>

<p>Two guys ended up getting hauled away in the back of a police car and the car ended up getting towed so we'll never know what was in the trunk.</p>
<p>(<em>Not depicted on Twitter</em>: Sue and I arguing over whether a early 80's model car would have a trunk release, as opposed to just being opened with keys, and then why the cops weren't just using a crow bar to pry the trunk open.  Also not depicted, Damien waking up crying 20 minutes after everything was finished and we were almost asleep.)</p>

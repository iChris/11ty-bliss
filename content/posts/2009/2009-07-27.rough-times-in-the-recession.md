title: "Rough Times in the Recession"
---
<p>I'm not sure what your experience has been, but I've seen lots of people who are taking vacations, buying boats, cars or other vehicles, and generally <strong>not</strong> feeling any effects of the supposed recession we've been in for the last year.</p>
<p>From my casual observations, it seems to be the rich who complain about the recession while not really suffering and the poor who actually suffer but do a lot less complaining.  I would guess that donations to causes/religious organizations are down while purchases of luxury items isn't all that much less as people buy more things to help them deal with all the stress of the recession.</p>
<p>At least that's my casual observation while I sip a latte in a coffee shop at the lake.  <em>(cough) hypocrite</em>  Plenty of boats guzzling plenty of gas being pulled around by plenty of trucks guzzling plenty of more gas.</p>
<p>Times are tough.</p>

title: "Cards App for iOS"
---
<p>Phew. Busy day of updates if you're an Apple fan(atic). </p>
<p><a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/stat?id=6PFrOqNV4B8&offerid=146261&type=3&subid=0&tmpid=1826&RD_PARM1=http%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fca%252Fapp%252Fcards%252Fid464957209%253Fmt%253D8%2526uo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30" target="itunes_store">Cards</a> (<em>also free in the App Store, also requires iOS5</em>) is available for download.</p>
<p>Cards lets you create a postcard from your own photos and text, using Apple's provided templates, which Apple then mails out for you. With a custom designed stamp from Apple, naturally. All for $4.99 per card.</p>
<p>The cards look beautiful, as you would suspect from Apple. But it is a funny app/service to release when everything else Apple is doing is pushing people away from real items into digital.</p>

<p>You'll need to be running OS 10.6.6 which is available through software update (<em>Go to the Apple in the top left corner of your screen, click 'Software Update' and you're off to the races</em>).</p>

<p>After a reboot you'll have a new app icon sitting in your dock.</p>
<p><strong>Initial thoughts</strong>: I can't wait until the next piece of software I need to help my dad install and I can just send him a link and say "buy this."  Definitely makes life much easier to buy and install applications on a Mac.</p>
<p><strong>Recommended first apps</strong>: <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/ca/app/twitter/id409789998?mt=12">Twitter for Mac is free</a>, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/ca/app/the-incident/id408679233?mt=12">The Incident is a great little game that I play on the iPhone</a> as is <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/ca/app/angry-birds/id403961173?mt=12">Angry Birds</a>.  The really great thing is now you can buy individual apps within Apple's iLife and iWork suite - so <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/ca/app/iphoto/id408981381?mt=12">iPhoto is only $14.99</a> and you don't have to get iMovie or Garageband if you don't ever use them.</p>

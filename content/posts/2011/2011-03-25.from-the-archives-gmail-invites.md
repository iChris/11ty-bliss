title: "From the Archives: Gmail Invites"

<p>From back in 2004, entitled <a href="https://chrisenns.com/2004/06/15/more-gmail-action/">More Gmail Action</a>, when Gmail was an invite only site. </p>
<p>Obviously I didn't have the good sense to try and sell my invites on ebay.</p>
<p>Google still has the Invite a Friend box in Gmail:</p>

<p>Though I'm not sure why they put a limit on it when it's free to sign up for now.</p>

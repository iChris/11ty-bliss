<p>It's available <a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/stat?id=6PFrOqNV4B8&offerid=146261&type=3&subid=0&tmpid=1826&RD_PARM1=http%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fca%252Fapp%252Fpopclip%252Fid445189367%253Fmt%253D12%2526uo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30" target="itunes_store">from the Mac App Store for $4.99</a> or you can <a href="https://pilotmoon.com/popclip/">download a free trial from their website</a> that has a neat method of expiring: you get 150 uses of the app before you have to buy it.</p>

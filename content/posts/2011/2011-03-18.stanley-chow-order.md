title: "Stanley Chow Order"

<p>I'm putting together an order of a print from <a href="https://stanleychow.bigcartel.com/">Stanley Chow</a> - anyone want to add anything to the order to save him/us on shipping it across the pond?</p>

<p>As thanks for interviewing him for <a href="https://ssktn.com/podcasts/welcometotheinternet/012-welcome-to-the-internet-stanley-chow/">Welcome to the Internet</a>, he sent me a copy of his tribute to <a href="https://stanleychow.bigcartel.com/product/mr-mrs-von-trapp-a2">The Sound of Music</a> and I can attest to the quality of both the design and the print. Beautiful stuff.</p>
<p>Hit me up on <a href="/contact/">the contact page</a> with your details if you're interested.</p>
<p>Can you guess which poster finally pushed me over <em>the edge</em> to order something?</p>

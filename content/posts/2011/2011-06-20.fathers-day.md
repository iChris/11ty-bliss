title: "Father''s Day"

<p>Among other things, the best gift I received this father's day was this.</p>
<p>"I forgot to say Happy Father's Day!" and gave me a hug.</p>
<p><em>Which wasn't completely true as he had said "Happy Father's Day" on more than one occasion.</em></p>
<p>He then started digging into his pocket and pulled out an individual Peanut Butter Cup mini for him and myself. Nicely squished and slightly melted.</p>
<p>I haven't had a better tasting Peanut Butter Cup treat in my life.</p>

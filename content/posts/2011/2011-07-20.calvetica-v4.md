<p>An update to my favourite iPhone calendar app, Calvetica.</p>
<blockquote><p>Add an event in just two quick taps. See how full your week or day is at a glance. It works with the built-in iPhone calendar but itâ€™s faster.</p></blockquote>
<p>In Apple style, they re-wrote it from the ground up. It looks great and I am loving the new gesture support for navigating your way around the app. <a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/stat?id=6PFrOqNV4B8&offerid=146261&type=3&subid=0&tmpid=1826&RD_PARM1=http%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fca%252Fapp%252Fcalvetica-calendar%252Fid385862462%253Fmt%253D8%2526uo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30" target="itunes_store">Pick it up from the App Store for only $1.99</a>.</p>

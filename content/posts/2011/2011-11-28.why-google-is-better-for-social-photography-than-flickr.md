title: "Why Google+ Is Better for Social Photography Than Flickr"
---
<p>Thomas Hawk makes a good case for <a href="https://thomashawk.com/2011/11/10-reasons-why-google-is-better-for-social-photography-than-flickr.html">why Google+ is better than Flickr</a> for sharing your photos from the perspective of a professional photographer.</p>
<p>I don't really see it yet for the casual/semi-pro photographer, but Flickr certainly has to see the writing on the wall. It's too bad Yahoo bought out Flickr because a smaller company would be much more hungry to fight for users than a Yahoo subsidiary.</p>

<p>From the description on the <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/deanheckler/onelessdrop">site</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>In the time it takes to read this page, millions of power cords for mobile phones, iPads, and notebooks will slide off nightstands, side tables, and desks and fall to the ground.

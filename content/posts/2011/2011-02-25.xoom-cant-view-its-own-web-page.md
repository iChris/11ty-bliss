<p>This is Motorola (hardware) and Google's (software) answer to the iPad - the Motorola Xoom. If you try and browse to it's own product page on the web, you get the Flash installer screen. Flash isn't currently able to run on the Xoom.</p>

<p>Does no one think of these things in a company the size of Motorola? And didn't anyone at Google give them a heads up that this might not be a good idea?</p>

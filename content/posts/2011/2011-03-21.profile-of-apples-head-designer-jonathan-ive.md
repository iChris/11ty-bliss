title: "Profile of Apple's Head Designer, Jonathan Ive"

<blockquote><p>By designing that first iMac in 1998 and its ever more sleek successors, then the iPod, iPhone and iPad, Ive has helped turn Apple Inc from an also-ran popular chiefly with designers into the second biggest company in the world, with a higher turnover than Google or Microsoft. He will receive Â£15 million in Apple shares alone next year.</p></blockquote>

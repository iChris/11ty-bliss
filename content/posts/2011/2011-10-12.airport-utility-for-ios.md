title: "AirPort Utility for iOS"
---
<p>Apple has released <a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/stat?id=6PFrOqNV4B8&offerid=146261&type=3&subid=0&tmpid=1826&RD_PARM1=http%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fca%252Fapp%252Fairport-utility%252Fid427276530%253Fmt%253D8%2526uo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30" target="itunes_store">AirPort Utility for iOS</a>. A free app that allows you to setup, configure and test wireless networks utilizing Apple's <a href="https://www.apple.com/wifi/">Airport base stations or Time Capules</a>.</p>
<p>Interesting that when Apple is phasing out the use of "Airport" in favour of the industry standard Wi-Fi (<em>For example, the wireless network menubar used to say "Turn Airport Off", as of OS X Lion it says "Turn Wi-Fi Off"</em>), this app is still called AirPort Utility.</p>
<p>iOS5 is required to use Airport Utility.</p>

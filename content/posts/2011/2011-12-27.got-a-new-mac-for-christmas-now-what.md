<p>As I mentioned, all of the above apps are produced by Don McAllister. If you'd rather just have access to his full library of training videos and tutorials you can <a href="https://www.screencastsonline.com/scoaffiliates/jrox.php?id=626_1_bid_13">buy a 3 month membership for $57</a>. 320+ tutorials plus a new video added every week.</p>
<p>[box style="info"]If you'd like to hear more from Don, <a href="https://ssktn.com/podcasts/welcometotheinternet/020-welcome-to-the-internet-don-mcallister/">I interviewed him on a recent episode of Welcome to the Internet</a>.[/box]</p>
<h2>Sites to Read / Podcasts to Listen To</h2>
<p>There are new Mac blogs and websites popping up every other day so I'm sure you'll find the ones that appeal to you, but here's a few that I read regularly.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.tuaw.com/">TUAW.com</a> The Unofficial Apple Weblog has news about Mac stuff as well as tutorials and tips/tricks thrown in.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.macsparky.com/">MacSparky.com</a> is a site for more of the work side of the Mac.</li>
<li><a href="https://5by5.tv/mpu">Mac Power Users Podcast</a> The podcast companion to MacSparky - The Mac Power Users currently has 67 episodes covering all sorts of topics on how to use your Mac, iPhone and iPad.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.apple.com/iphone/tips/">Apple's Tips for iPhone</a> Some tips you may not have heard of or seen.</li>
<li><a href="https://macworld.com/">Macworld.com</a> Macworld is the online version of the popular Mac magazine. The main site is somewhat useless to me, but there's plenty of good articles in their <a href="https://www.macworld.com/howto.html">How To</a> section.</li>
<li><a href="https://twit.tv/show/the-tech-guy">The Tech Guy</a> Leo Laporte is considered the godfather of podcasting and he's got lots of video or audio shows devoted to all things tech. The Tech Guy isn't focused on Mac exclusively, but there's lots of tips for the hardware/software newbie.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.apple.com/support/">Apple's Support Site</a> Apple's own support site is a great resource and many Google searches will result in you ending up on their forums or support articles. <a href="https://support.apple.com/videos/">Videos</a>, <a href="https://support.apple.com/manuals/">manuals</a>, and <a href="https://discussions.apple.com/index.jspa">community forums</a> are all worth a visit if you're stuck on something with your Mac or iPhone/iPad.</li>
</ul>
<p>There's my quick list. I'd love to hear what sites you visit for Mac support and tips/tricks - leave a comment with your resource.</p>

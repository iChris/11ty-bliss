title: "New Version of Twitter"
---
<p>Twitter has launched a new version - available first on <a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/stat?id=6PFrOqNV4B8&offerid=146261&type=3&subid=0&tmpid=1826&RD_PARM1=http%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fca%252Fapp%252Ftwitter%252Fid333903271%253Fmt%253D8%2526uo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30" target="itunes_store">Twitter for iPhone or iPad</a> and their other mobile platforms.</p>
<p><em>Cue the complaining from everyone who hates redesigns, no matter what it improves.</em></p>

<p>The site <a href="https://fly.twitter.com/">fly.twitter.com</a> is a beautifully designed explanation of how Twitter works and what the new version brings to Twitter. They mention on the site:</p>
<blockquote><p>Download the latest version of Twitter for iPhone or Twitter for Android to get access to the redesigned Twitter on your computer.</p></blockquote>
<p>...but I'm not seeing it yet.</p>
<p>I haven't been using the Twitter app for iPhone lately <sup id="fnref-19883:1"><a href="#fn-19883:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> so it feels very different to me. It's certainly a much cleaner look than what I remember it having. I can't see myself using the new Discover or Me tab very often, if at all - other than that they've buried Direct Messages under the Me tab so now it's two taps to get to your messages.</p>
<p>It'll be interesting to see how they've integrated the new look into <a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/stat?id=6PFrOqNV4B8&offerid=146261&type=3&subid=0&tmpid=1826&RD_PARM1=http%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fca%252Fapp%252Ftwitter%252Fid409789998%253Fmt%253D12%2526uo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30" target="itunes_store">the desktop app for Mac</a>.</p>

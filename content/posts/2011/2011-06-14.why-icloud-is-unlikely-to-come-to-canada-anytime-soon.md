title: "Why iCloud Is Unlikely to Come to Canada Anytime Soon"
---
<p>Michael Geist, law professor at the University of Ottawa and all around knowledgable guy on copyright law, lays out the reasons why we won't see any of the cloud music services coming to the great white north anytime soon.</p>
<p>It's similar to when the iTunes Music Store first launched in the U.S. It took close to 2 years (don't have the exact time in front of me) for it to launch in Canada due to all the licensing issues.</p>
<p>It comes down to money and the record labels wanting a little extra piece of a pie they no longer really need to be getting a part of anymore.</p>

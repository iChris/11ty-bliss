title: "Don't Be a Free User"
---
<p>Maciej Ceglowski runs the popular <sup id="fnref-19880:1"><a href="#fn-19880:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> bookmarking service <a href="https://pinboard.in">Pinboard.in</a>, of which I'm a <a href="https://pinboard.in/u:ichris">happily paid-up user</a>. He recently <a href="https://blog.pinboard.in/2011/12/don_t_be_a_free_user/">wrote a blog post</a> on the <em>value</em> of free web services and how free isn't always better:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Were you a big Gowalla fan? Did you like Dodgeball? Did you think Trunk.ly (gasp!) was better than Pinboard? Did you make a lot of contributions to Nextstop? Do you miss Aardvark and EtherPad? Did "I Want Sandy" change your life?</p>
<p>  These projects are all very different, but the dynamic is the same. Someone builds a cool, free product, it gets popular, and that popularity attracts a buyer. The new owner shuts the product down and the founders issue a glowing press release about how excited they are about synergies going forward. They are never heard from again.
</p></blockquote>
<p>You might not be that familiar with some of the sites he mentioned, but the idea should ring true for whatever <em>free</em> service you're currently using. It might be free to use, but in most cases it's you that's the product. Google sells advertising based on your use of their <em>free</em> email, search and other services. Same with Facebook and it's <em>free</em> services.</p>
<p>I know, I know. Facebook is too big to ever go away. You're right. Nothing to worry about.</p>
<p>Maciej also wins the award for the best disclaimer on a blog post:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  DISCLAIMER: I run a paid bookmarking site. Every morning I wake up and dive into my vault of golden coins.

title: "Lent is Over"
---
<blockquote><p>I like to think I’m immune from being influenced by technology such as this, but I know how naïve that thought is.</p></blockquote>
<p>I definitely noticed that I'd be much less inclined to quickly pull out my iPhone to check updates on Twitter at random moments throughout the day. I can't say that my time was used that much better because it really is a whole bunch of quick distractions throughout the day - as opposed to, for example, giving up TV for lent where you'll find whole blocks of time that you'd otherwise spend watching The Bachelor.</p>
<p>Not that I know anyone who does that.</p>
<p>I was also able to focus a lot more on blogging. Rather than quickly tweet about a thought, I'd have to spend a bit more time processing it and coming up with something more interesting to say than what I could spit out in 140 characters. I'm not sure if it was better for anyone else, but I certainly enjoyed the challenge of longer form writing again.</p>
<h3>The Noise and the Fury</h3>
<p>The main thing I've noticed in the day and half since turning my <a href="https://www.twitter.com/ichris">main Twitter account</a> back on is how noisy it is. The retweets from people about topics I don't care about (you can remove those by looking for <a href="https://d.pr/mfs9">this icon</a>), the location updates (people checking in on <a href="https://foursquare.com/">Foursquare</a> or <a href="https://gowalla.com/">Gowalla</a>, or people tweeting what a company tells them to in order to be entered into a contest.</p>
<p>I've turned off seeing RT's from most of the people I otherwise find interesting and I've un-followed folks who abuse the other examples too much.</p>
<h3>It's All About the Numbers</h3>
<p>It's not really. But for the stats nerds, here's where I was when I <a href="/2011/03/08/giving-up-twitter-for-lent/">left Twitter for Lent</a>:</p>
<p><a href="https://chrisenns.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/twitteraccountdetails.jpg"><img src="https://chrisenns.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/twitteraccountdetails-300x51.jpg" alt="" title="twitteraccountdetails" width="300" height="51" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-19368" /></a></p>
<p><em>Following 487 and 605 followers.</em></p>
<p>And now here's where I am after getting back on the Twitter train and kicking some folks off:</p>
<p><img src="https://chrisenns.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/twitterafterlent.jpg" alt="" title="twitterafterlent" width="460" height="77" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-19491" /></p>
<p><em>Following 378 and 601 followers.</em></p>
<p>You win some, you lose some.</p>
<p>As with many things in life, particularly in the technology realm, it's good to remove them for a period to be able to evaluate their worth and whether you really need to keep it around.</p>
<p>I'll continue to use Twitter, but will be trying to keep it's distracting ability to a minimum going forward by being strict about who/what I follow and by resisting the urge to <em>quickly</em> check for updates throughout the day.</p>

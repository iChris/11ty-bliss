title: "No Siri for Canada... Yet"
---
<p>If you look at <a href="https://www.apple.com/">Apple.com</a> and compare it with  <a href="https://www.apple.com/ca/">Apple.ca</a>, there's one key thing missing in the features listed for the iPhone 4S:</p>
<h3>Apple.ca</h3>
<p><img src="https://chrisenns.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/iPhone4Canada.png" alt="" title="iPhone4Canada" width="355" height="301" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-19673" /></p>
<h3>Apple.com</h3>
<p><img src="https://chrisenns.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/iPhone4US.png" alt="" title="iPhone4US" width="370" height="365" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-19674" /></p>
<p>Sadly, no <a href="https://www.apple.com/iphone/features/siri.html">Siri</a> for Canada. Yet.</p>
<p>It's <a href="https://www.loopinsight.com/2011/10/04/siri-is-coming-to-canada/">coming</a>, just looks like Apple has to "Canadian-ize" it first. So, adding in a few "eh's", some bacon, and the ability to understand all the requests for "Siri, why didn't the Leafs make the playoffs again this year?"</p>

<p>Might as well download it today rather than get caught up with everyone else downloading it tomorrow when <a href="https://www.apple.com/icloud/">iCloud is launched</a>.</p>
<p>Use <a href="https://www.apple.com/itunes/download/">this link</a> to download it directly or just hit up Software Update under the Apple (top left corner of your Mac).</p>

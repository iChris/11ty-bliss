title: "Magnet Boy of Croatia"

<p>The kid already knows how to pose like a superhero. Not sure how his superpower can be used for good - seems more like a power that would work against him. Maybe with more training he can learn how to reverse the polarity of his magnetic attraction and start repelling metal objects as he walks around.</p>

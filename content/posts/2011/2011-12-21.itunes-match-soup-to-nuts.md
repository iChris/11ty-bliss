title: "iTunes Match Soup to Nuts"
---
<p>I hadn't really heard the phrase <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soup_to_nuts">soup to nuts</a></em> until I started listening to the odd <a href="https://5by5.tv/mpu">Mac Power Users</a> podcasts with <a href="https://5by5.tv/person/david-sparks">David Sparks</a> &amp; <a href="https://5by5.tv/person/katie-floyd">Katie Floyd</a> - maybe it's more common among lawyers?<sup id="fnref-19944:1"><a href="#fn-19944:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>
<p>In <a href="https://5by5.tv/mpu/66">episode 66 of Mac Power Users</a> David &amp; Katie do a <em>soup to nuts</em> walk through of the process of switching over to <a href="https://www.apple.com/ca/itunes/whats-new/">iTunes Match</a> on your Mac and iOS devices.</p>

<p>Normally with these kinds of things I just hit the sign-up button and let the computer do it's thing. But when it comes to my 4,300+ song music library, I get a little picky and worry about things disappearing such as playlists, play counts, and other metadata that is stored in all those MP3s &amp; M4a files.</p>
<p>So if you're like me and want to know what's going to happen when you click the sign-up button, <a href="https://5by5.tv/mpu/66">listen to the podcast</a>.</p>

title: "iA Writer for Mac"
---
<p>Interesting new writing application for Mac. It won't be for everyone but I certainly welcome the approach to getting rid of preferences and all the annoying chrome that Word has foisted upon anyone hoping to type up a document.</p>
<blockquote><p>iA Writer has no preferences. It is how it is. It works like it works. Love it or hate it. Itâ€™s unique FocusMode allows me to think, spell and write at one sentence at a time. iA Writer is fast; it works without mouse. It automatically formats semantical entities such as headlines, lists, bold, strong, block quotes written in markdown.</p></blockquote>

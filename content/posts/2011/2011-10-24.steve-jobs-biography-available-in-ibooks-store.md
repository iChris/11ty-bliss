<p>I think I'll still pick up a hardcover at some point, but it was nice to be able to load up iBooks on my wife's iPad and start reading <a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/stat?id=6PFrOqNV4B8&offerid=146261&type=3&subid=0&tmpid=1826&RD_PARM1=http%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fca%252Fbook%252Fsteve-jobs%252Fid431617578%253Fmt%253D11%2526uo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30" target="itunes_store">Steve Jobs biography</a> right after watching the interview with the author, Walter Isaacson, on <a href="https://mashable.com/2011/10/23/steve-jobs-walter-isaacson-60-minutes-video/">60 Minutes</a>. </p>
<p>Fitting that it's the first digital-only book I've purchased.</p>

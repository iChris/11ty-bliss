title: "A Love Letter to TextMate"
---
<p>In case you were confused by <a href="https://chrisenns.com/2011/12/12/textmate-2-the-waitinging/">yesterday's little video</a>, well, this probably won't help much either and will just make you think nerds are even weirder than you already thought.</p>
<p>Matt Gemmell <a href="https://mattgemmell.com/2011/12/13/dear-textmate/">wrote a letter to TextMate</a> that explains a bit of the heartache of waiting for an update that may never come to many a nerd's favourite text editor:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  I still remember the early days - they were amazing. The bundles, new stuff every week, the syntax highlighting (<em>oh man, the syntax highlighting</em>). Yeah. Those were good times. It wasn’t just me, right?</p>
<p>  And the money thing. Ugh. That really messed us up. You always insisted on paying, even though I was happy to. I could have supported you; I was glad to help with that. Maybe you could have got to 2.0 sooner. But you didn’t give me the chance. It just all felt a bit one-sided.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Yeah, so you're probably more confused now than ever.</p>

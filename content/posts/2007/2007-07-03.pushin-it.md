<p>Funny Damien moment:  We're sitting on the couch reading/watching Tv with Damien sleeping on the cushion between us.  He likes to sleep on his back with arms raised up behind his head - really relaxed.  Every so often he pulls his legs up and lets 'er rip and we laugh.  I think we'll have to rock/paper/scissors to see who changes his diaper.</p>

<p>We decided to try and get out of the house a bit and have a little picnic on our deck Saturday night.  It was beautiful out - just a slight breeze and warm enough to just sit comfortably.</p>

<p>Afterwards we met up with Mark and Susanna, who recently moved into our area as well (Go West Siders!) and introduced them to ice cream/milkshakes at Harry &amp; Rita's on 33rd.</p>

<p>Can you spot Damien in the middle of all this candy?</p>

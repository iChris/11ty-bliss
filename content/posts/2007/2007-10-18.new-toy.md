title: "New Toy"
---
<p>This is the first toy we've bought Damien and he seems pretty excited about it!  Thanks to Heather's great searching skills we got it for only $20 off <a href="https://saskatoon.kijiji.ca/">Kijiji</a>.  I'm pretty happy about it too, since I was putting him in the bouncy chair all day long and I think he was getting sick of it.   </p>

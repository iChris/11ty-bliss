Apple famously sells wheels for their Mac Pro at around $700USD / [$869CAD](https://www.apple.com/ca/shop/product/MX572ZM/A/apple-mac-pro-wheels-kit) and so naturally people are wondering what else they can use those wheels for.

Why not a skateboard?

We discovered [Braille Skateboarding](https://brailleskateboarding.com/) today because my son took a wad of his birthday money and bought his first skateboard and naturally started searching YouTube for tutorials. Braille has a [great YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9PgszLOAWhQC6orYejcJlw) for anyone looking to learn how to skateboard. 

The Mac nerd in me noticed [this video they made about using the Mac Pro wheel kit on a skateboard](https://youtu.be/IvAX1vQJnAU):

> We ordered the wheels asap, got a brand new deck, and made the magic that you see in this video. Are these the best skateboard wheels ever?!

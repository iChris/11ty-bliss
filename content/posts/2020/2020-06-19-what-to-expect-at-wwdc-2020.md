Big week next week. [MacRumors on what to expect at WWDC 2020:](https://www.macrumors.com/guide/wwdc-2020-what-to-expect/)

> Apple plans to hold a virtual keynote, which is set to take place on Monday, June 22. Though there's no physical event this year, Apple still has big plans for WWDC. Along with the usual software updates, rumors suggest Apple could unveil a redesigned iMac and give us our first glimpse at the custom-designed Arm-based chips it will use for future Macs

Memo to Apple hardware designers: I will *never* want a slimmer iMac. If you made it twice as thick as it is now but shipped it with a kick ass camera - I don't know, borrowed from your iPhone chasis maybe? - that would be a tempting reason to upgrade my 2015 iMac. Once less USB cable and extra Logitech camera mounted on top is reason to upgrade, besides the usual performance improvements.

Boasting about a 1.5mm thick computer? To borrow from Shania Twain - [that don't impress me much](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqFLXayD6e8).

And please ship a new Apple TV.

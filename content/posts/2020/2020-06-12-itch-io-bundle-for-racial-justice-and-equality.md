The [bundle](https://itch.io/b/520/bundle-for-racial-justice-and-equality) is an incredible deal on over 1,500 indie games and creative work, with an even more incredible amount of money raised as a result of the sale - [it's now raised over $5 million dollars](https://www.polygon.com/2020/6/11/21287738/itchio-bundle-for-racial-justice-equality-black-lives-matter-charity) for the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund and the Community Bail Fund.

Polygon has [a post with some of their suggestions of games to play](https://www.polygon.com/2020/6/11/21287814/racial-justice-equality-bundle-recommendations-itchio-black-lives-matter), but just looking at the list I'd recommend trying Overland, Night in the Woods, Celeste, and A Short Hike as starting points.

I don't think I'll ever tire of watching these "how they did it" visual effects reels from Star Wars movies. [Direct link to video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBvi8opWTiQ&feature=youtu.be)

What I loved about Rogue One is how you really felt the oppression of the Empire over the people in a way that A New Hope wasn't really able to show. The city scapes are so detailed and intricate and really immerse the viewer in what it felt like to be ruled by an evil galatic empire.

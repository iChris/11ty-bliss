This is why I can't just [up and quit Twitter](https://twitter.com/iChris/status/1290647830953156614).

I follow [Aidan Fitzpatrick](https://twitter.com/afit) because he runs the company that created [Camo](https://reincubate.com/camo/), an app for your Mac and a complimentary app for iOS that allows you to use your iPhone or iPad as a webcam for chat apps like Zoom, etc. (I even made a [video about how well it works](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtAfNo_5Y5w)). He recently shared a tweet from someone I don't follow and hadn't ever come across - [Tyler Hall](https://twitter.com/tylerhall) - who appears to be a [Mac and iOS app developer](https://clickontyler.com/).

The tweet Aidan shared was [this one about the Mac utility app Tyler wrote that syncs the positions of your Desktop icons](https://twitter.com/tylerhall/status/1289822258014203905) - not just the contents of your desktop like iCloud Desktop Sync does, but the actual positions of the icons. [Pretty sweet bit of Mac nerdy fun](https://tyler.io/jigsaw-visually-sync-your-mac-desktop/).

Now I'm subscribed to Tyler's blog, [Tyler.io](https://tyler.io/), which is full of other awesome Mac nerdy fun like:

* [DIY Video hosting](https://tyler.io/diy-video-hosting/)
* An app he wrote called [Grannysmith for syncing and backing up iCloud Photo Libraries](https://tyler.io/grannysmith/)
* [DidYouHearThat](https://tyler.io/do-you-hear-that/) - an app to switch where audio is routed out of on your Mac with your keyboard.
* Click-baity article titles like [Running commands remotely on a Mac that you don't have access to using Hazel and Dropbox](https://tyler.io/running-commands-remotely-on-a-mac-that-you-dont-have-access-to-using-hazel-and-dropbox/) for the Mac productivity nerd in all of us.
* He even wrote a Static Website Generator in Swift called [Roland](https://tyler.io/roland-static-website-generator-swift/).

So that's why I can't quit Twitter just yet. Until all of you start blogging properly again, I can't reliably find out about interesting new nerds any other way.

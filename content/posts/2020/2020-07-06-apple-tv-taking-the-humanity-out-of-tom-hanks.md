Thanks to Apple for saving us from seeing Tom Hanks in his actual office. If there's anything the world needs now, it's a more generic visual experience.

[Via Macrumors](https://www.macrumors.com/2020/07/06/tom-hanks-heartbreaking-greyhound/):

> Apple TV‌+ is having a similarly negative impact on Hanks’ appearance in this interview. Even though he is in his office, “the cruel whipmasters at Apple” decided the background needed to be a blank wall, presumably so nosy journalists like me wouldn’t spend the whole encounter snooping at Hanks’ bookcases. Against the eerily empty backdrop, he looks, Hanks rightly says, as if he’s in “a witness protection programme. But here I am, bowing to the needs of ‌Apple TV‌.”

I've got a draft post on having an authentic online experience - especially as small businesses and non-profits try moving to live streaming and video. I love getting a glimpse into the home studios, offices, and kitchens of humans via a $50 webcam who otherwise are polished up and thrown in front of $500,000 worth of production equipment and filters.

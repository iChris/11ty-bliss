In an attempt to curb my Twitter addiction and revive reading longer form articles, I've subscribed to [Feedbin](https://feedbin.com/) on my Mac, and am using [NetNewsWire](http://netnewswireapp.com/ios/) on my iPhone to read blogs like it's 2010.

I believe that part of reading and subscribing is also contributing back into the blogging ecosystem by sharing what I found interesting. So this is my attempt to do that with a semi-regular link post. Ideally I'll just write a single post about a thing I really feel is worth linking to, but a link dump like this helps clear the backlog. I'm not sure I've got the most efficient method to do this yet, but it can be refinded as I go. I'll write up my method in a future post. 

Here's what I've found interesting or link-worthy so far this week:

* [Social networking app for women, Peanut, is rolling out video chat](https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/16/social-networking-app-for-women-peanut-is-rolling-out-video-chat/)

> The company, which began its life with a focus on motherhood, has evolved over the years to reach women looking to discuss a range of topics — including pregnancy, marriage, parenthood, and even menopause.

* [How To Wind Down a Pandemic Podcast](https://hotpodnews.com/how-to-wind-down-a-pandemic-podcast/)

> Plenty of teams are now contemplating winding down those pandemic shows — both as a reflection of how the world has changed, and as a way of taking care of employee health. To understand the decisions around how and when this is happening, I spoke with two teams of different sizes that substantially stepped up their workload in the face of the coronavirus crisis, and are now transitioning to a more sustainable arrangement.

* [Apple, ARM, and Intel](https://stratechery.com/2020/apple-arm-and-intel/) - I love Ben Thompson's take on Apple news. Less hype about hardware magic, and more about the business behind the decisions.

> What remains to be seen is just how quickly Apple will push ARM into its higher-end computers. Again, the A13 is already competitive with some of Intel’s best desktop chips, and the A13 is tuned for mobile; what sort of performance gains can Apple uncover by building for more generous thermal envelopes? It is not out of the question that Apple, within a year or two, has by far the best performing laptops and desktop computers on the market, just as they do in mobile.

* [The Best Project Management Software for Your Tasks & Teams](https://www.elegantthemes.com/blog/business/best-project-management-software) - my friend [Tee](https://www.teeiseminger.com/) and I have regular conversations about project management apps. I think we've both tried at least half of the software mentioned in this article.

* [Consumers Aren't Ready to Pay for Podcasts But Platforms Keep Trying](https://variety.com/vip/consumers-arent-ready-to-pay-for-podcasts-but-platforms-keep-trying-1234631968/) (*via [Podnews](https://podnews.net)*) - It seems like every week there's a new app designed to help podcasters solicit money from their listeners in some way.

* [Custom Masks printed with your own face](https://www.swiss-miss.com/2020/06/masks-custom-printed-with-your-own-face.html) - you have to see the GIF to understand how... odd this would be.

* [What Will macOS 10.16 Be Called?](https://www.macrumors.com/2020/06/15/macos-10-16-names/) - I'm still holding out hope for macOS Saskatchewan.

* [Star Wars Squadron announced](https://sixcolors.com/link/2020/06/star-wars-squadrons-preps-for-launch/) - including a fun looking [cinematic trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w0eRkhR1z6A&feature=youtu.be)

* [Kids now spend nearly as much time watching TikTok as YouTube in US, UK and Spain](https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/04/kids-now-spend-nearly-as-much-time-watching-tiktok-as-youtube-in-u-s-u-k-and-spain/)

> The data in the annual report by digital safety app maker Qustodio was provided by 60,000 families with children ages four to 14 in the U.S., U.K. and Spain, so its data isn’t representative of global trends. The research encompasses children’s online habits from February 2019 to April 2020, takes into account the COVID-19 crisis and is specifically focused on four main categories of mobile applications: online video, social media, video games and education.

* [The Pigeon Stays Home](https://blog.ultranurd.net/2020/03/16/the-pigeon-stays-at-home/)

> One of my son’s favorite author-illustrators, Mo Willems, is doing a daily video stream for everyone under quarantine called Lunch Doodles with Mo Willems.

* [Why I Don't Drink](https://lauren-allen.net/blog//why-i-dont-drink)

> Unconsciously, I grabbed the bottle and started drinking. I didn’t think about it. It was around lunchtime, my eyes were so swollen I felt like I couldn’t open them, and I thought, “yes. Alcohol will make this feeling go away.” And then I thought, “Wait- I’ve read about this. And I don’t want to do it.”

* [Shortcuts for archiving Apple Music playlists](https://jacobtender.net/blog/shortcuts-for-archiving-apple-music-playlists/) - I'm a sucker for metadata organizing automation posts.

Great deal on my favorite password management app for macOS / iOS [from MacRumors](https://www.macrumors.com/2020/07/09/macrumors-exclusive-1password/):

> The 1Password Individual account regularly runs for $2.99/month, billed annually at $35.88. With our exclusive discount, you can get this plan for $17.94 for the first year of 1Password. Additionally, you'll receive a 30 day free trial when first signing up for the Individual Plan.

Hopefully available to Canadian users as well but make sure to doublecheck all the details before you commit.

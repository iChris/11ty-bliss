[Ben Thompson on the end of OS X](https://stratechery.com/2020/the-end-of-os-x/):

> What is striking about macOS 11.0 is the degree to which is feels more like a son of iOS than the sibling that Mac OS X was:
> * macOS 11.0 runs on ARM, just like iOS; in fact the Developer Transition Kit that Apple is making available to developers has the same A12Z chip as the iPad Pro.
> * macOS 11.0 has a user interface overhaul that not only appears to be heavily inspired by iOS, but also seems geared for touch.
> * macOS 11.0 attempts to acquire developers not primarily by being open and good, but by being easy and good enough.

It's a good look back at where macOS has come from - including the [cringey funeral for Classic Mac OS](https://videopress.com/v/cTvJLHm8) - and where it's headed.

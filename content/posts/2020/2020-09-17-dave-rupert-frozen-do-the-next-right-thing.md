I very much dig what Dave's saying in this post, titled "[Do the next right thing](https://daverupert.com/2020/09/do-the-next-right-thing/)", taking inspiration from Frozen II:

When staring at a mountain of tasks and projects, sometimes it’s tough to figure out the next step. “Do the next right thing” has echoed in my head and pushed me along.

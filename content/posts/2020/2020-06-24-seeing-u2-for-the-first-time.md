Reaction videos are a big genre on YouTube and so it's no surprise that there are people doing reaction videos to seeing my favorite band, U2.

This reaction video by [TheJayyShow](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChvrXWHYgybT-2sYL-TEUig) to seeing U2 perform All I Want is You / Where the Streets Have No Name is a joy to watch. Not only is it a great performance by the band, but she's literally never heard of them. Never heard of Bono.

Even hardended U2 fans will get a kick out of watching this and seeing someone "get" the band - or at least their performance of these two songs which just so happens to be a couple of days after Bono's dad passed away and was immortalized in their DVD release [U2 Go Home: Live from Slane Castle, Ireland](https://amzn.to/2Vj4LIC).

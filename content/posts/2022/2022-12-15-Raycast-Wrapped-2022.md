Talk about knowing your audience. Like Spotify and many other apps, [Raycast](https://www.raycast.com) (I wrote about it [earlier this year](/2022/10/breaking-macos-rule/)) designed a "Raycast Wrapped" year in review for users of their app, with beautiful designed charts and graphs showing off how nerdy a Raycast user is.

Starting with usage:

<img src="/images/Raycast-Wrapped-20222.jpg" height="1244" width="1800" alt="Usage - climbing to the top. How productive I've been with Raycast this year. 1,357 opens, 940 actions performed, installed Raycast 183 days ago. Peak opening day is Thursday, hour is 9am.">

Next is effectiveness:

<img src="/images/Raycast-Wrapped-20223.jpg" height="1244" width="1800" alt="Effectivness with extensions. 20 extensions installed. 2 hotkeys. 2 aliases. SavvyCal is the latest addition. 5 quicklinks. Toggl Track is my most opened.">

Finally it's a random summary of more data:

<img src="/images/Raycast-Wrapped-20224.jpg" height="1244" width="1800" alt="Top 3 apps are Logic Pro, Remote Desktop, and Twitter. 715 total application launches. Opened Racast 1,357 times. 69 applications used. 940 total actions. My personality is listed as a Rayeti - unmatched productivity that is hard to find in real life.">

I'm a sucker for these kinds of things. We'll see if Raycast is truly sticky enough as an app launcher, and how my 2023 usage compares.

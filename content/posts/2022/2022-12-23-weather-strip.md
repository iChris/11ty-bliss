I've been using the default iOS weather app ever since upgrading to iOS16 and it's fine. But where it falls over for me is when winter hits here and it buries the "feels like" temperature in the app near the bottom. Any Canadian living on the prairies will tell you the "feels like" is as important, if not more so, than the actual temperature. It can often feel like 10 - 15 degrees C cooler than the actual temperature, which is the difference between a brisk walk outside and potential frost bite (or worse) if you go outside.

So I'm always curious what other people are using for weather apps, and when I saw [Craig Mod](https://craigmod.com) [post about the weather app he's using](https://mastodon.social/@craigmod/109562126847117507):

> Iâ€™ve been using Weather Strip for the last few months and it is phenomenal.

I had to try it out.

[Weather Strip](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/weather-strip/id1528594026) is an iPhone or iPad app from [Robin Stewart](https://twitter.com/RobinStewart) who's bio lists himself as being a "interactive math artist" and that's almost enough to know that Weather Strip is going to be a great app.

Besides looking great, it's got the "feels like" temperature line running all the way through the day. It combines cloud coverage, UV, rain or snow, and wind all in one scrollable main graph. And right below that is the next week's weather in a equally easy to tap display that updates the main view.

### Pricing

Weather Strip is has a free 14 day trial, and then works on a subscription model of either $4.99 / month or $21.49 / year for Premium, or has an option to share it with everyone on your iCloud Family Sharing plan for $7.49 / month or $31.99 / year (under $3 / month).

Premium adds global forecast data from [Foreca](https://www.foreca.com), which I suspect would give me better weather information than wherever Apple's default weather app is sourcing weather from - likely a US based weather provider, along with more frequent updates and the Home Screen widgets.

I find myself reluctant to pay for a weather app, not because I don't think apps aren't worth paying for - but because I so rarely [leave my house working from home](https://www.lemonproductions.ca) that it's not really that important to know all the things about weather.

But Weather Strip is so useful AND well designed that I'm really tempted. We'll see where I land after the 14 day trial runs out.

There are lots of great widget options for Weather Strip:

Just thought I'd show what warm temperatures look like. Sadly I won't get to test this out for another 4-6 months here. ðŸ¥¶

I always enjoy "best of" lists for the software platforms I use, not for the winners specifically, but because I usually find out about an app or service I didn't know existed.

In the case of [MacStories Best Apps of 2022](https://www.macstories.net/stories/macstories-selects-2022-recognizing-the-best-apps-of-the-year/), it was fun to see apps I already use make their list including [Audio Hijack for best app update](https://www.macstories.net/stories/macstories-selects-2022-recognizing-the-best-apps-of-the-year/#best-app-update), [Raycast for best Mac app](https://www.macstories.net/stories/macstories-selects-2022-recognizing-the-best-apps-of-the-year/#best-mac-app), and [Pixelmator Photo for best design](https://www.macstories.net/stories/macstories-selects-2022-recognizing-the-best-apps-of-the-year/#best-design) - but also interesting how many of the apps that made their best of revolve around organizing and playing music. I'd never even heard of [Marvis Pro which won their app of the year award](https://www.macstories.net/stories/macstories-selects-2022-recognizing-the-best-apps-of-the-year/#app-of-the-year).

Apple's Music app for iOS (*let's not even bother talking about the Mac version * ðŸ¤®) is usable at best. But generally it's a really frustrating process to find the music you want to play in a given moment. It feels like it's never in the right mode for whatever music I'm looking for. If I'm trying to find a song I know I've added to my library and listened to a lot, it can never find it. And if I'm trying to find a new song someone is recommending to me, it seems to find random music by artists completely unrelated.

I think the only thing keeping Apple Music alive and subscribed to in our family is the [Apple One bundle](https://www.apple.com/ca/apple-one/) we pay for that includes iCloud storage, Arcade, Apple TV+, and Fitness. At least half of my family is ready to fight for a switch to Spotify at any moment.

So I'm tempted to try out a new music player app like Mavis Pro since it's not so much the library of Apple Music that is the issue - it's, ironically for Apple, the user interface of their app that seems to be the issue.

But $11.99CAD is a lot to toss out on a hope and prayer that it'll be better at navigating our Apple Music library for me, and more importantly, for my family.

Again linking to Uncle Dave - this time on [website analytics](https://daverupert.com/2022/04/server-side-vs-client-side-analytics/):

> If I, or some hypothetical manager, put too much stock into these metrics I could see it causing a firestorm of reprioritization based on bot traffic. Weâ€™d be chasing the tail of a health check bot somewhere in Germany.

Your eyes may glaze over at the thought of reading about website traffic data, but it's worth a read as Dave compares a couple of services ([Netlify](https://netlify.com) vs [Fathom](https://usefathom.com/ref/YGPGBL)) and finds massive discrepancies in their reporting. It's not that anyone is doing anything shady or illegal either. That's just how unreliable web analytics are.

And yet I know there are people, businesses, and even yours truly who have made pretty big decisions on projects based around these kinds of numbers. I kept doing a podcast because my analytics told me there were potentially hundreds of listeners when in fact it was somewhere under 50. I've written blog posts chasing Google traffic that I thought was legitimate, when actually a lot of it was probably bots.

My ego wanted to believe the lies. My brain kind of always knew there wasn't anyone actually listening.

> Probably old advice, but you need a mixture of quantitative AND qualitative data to make good decisions.

I don't think you should throw out web analytics completely. If you have a lot more traffic one month than the previous, that still might mean *something*. But view it all with a healthy level of skepticism, and try to keep your the core DNA of whatever you're doing with the website intact.

title: "A Bully''s Resolutions"
---
<p>Gabe from Penny Arcade <a href="https://www.penny-arcade.com/2014/01/01/resolutions">wrote about his realization that he's a bully</a>. His story of being bullied in his past, how he dealt with it then and how it affects the business of running Penny Arcade now is sad - but I'm hopeful that he's headed in the right direction.</p>
<p>This line stuck out to me as a great quote for anyone struggling with their past and how they're letting it affect their present and future:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  I need to separate the busted kid from the man I am now.
</p></blockquote>
<p>I wonder if this digital internet world we live in enables people to not have to grow up in the same way people had to 20+ years ago.</p>

<p>First read <a href="https://www.penny-arcade.com/news/post/2014/08/20/csi-minecraft">this</a>.</p>

  My wife opened up the activity log and began cross-referencing the log in times of the various children with the what we believed was the time of the attack.

<blockquote><p>
  Interrogating your child is a novel experience, and we have many models in popular culture to inform us.  I was surprised at how exquisite the parallels were.  I could practically see the pattern of light from a lone and swinging phantom bulb.

<p>I love reading about how nerds have to navigate the parenting waters together on digital platforms and playgrounds that are no different than the real ones at the park.</p>
<p>I have an angry rant in my head pointed at people who give me that "someone spent how much time playing a dumb video game to build a stupid house?" whenever I mention Minecraft but I'll save that for a future <a href="https://goodstuff.fm/dailyish">Daily(ish)</a> episode I think. Swearing in audio is much more fun than swearing on a blog, right?</p>
<p>For now I'll leave it with Tycho's well written thoughts:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Minecraft is a game, and this game has rules.  You can give those rules more or less weight.  But it is also a one to one model of people and actions.  Which means that, among other things, they can learn about being human.

<p>Great looking game that's coming soon from the makers of <a href="https://bigbucketsoftware.com/theincident/">The Incident</a> (<a href="https://itunes.apple.com/ca/app/the-incident/id408679233?mt=12&uo=4&at=10l4Ki">Mac App Store</a>, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/ca/app/the-incident/id385533456?mt=8&amp;uo=4&amp;at=10l4Ki">iOS App Store</a>). I love the retro look and sound of Big Bucket Software's games - simple and pleasing yet still having a lot of depth and care to the gameplay. And on Space Age an interesting looking story to boot.</p>

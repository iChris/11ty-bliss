<p>Jim Dalrymple has had a review model for a couple weeks and <a href="https://www.loopinsight.com/2014/01/23/line-6-amplifi-guitar-amp-and-ipad-app/">he likes it</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Overall, I loved AMPLIFi, both as a guitarist and from a technology standpoint. The 75 watt version costs $399 and the 150 watt model is $499. This is an amp Iâ€™ll be using a lot.

<p>John Siracusa on his <a href="https://hypercritical.co/2014/01/14/the-road-to-geekdom">road to being a geek</a>, using his love of the Mac, RC cars and U2 as examples in his own life.</p>

  You don’t have to be a geek about everything in your life—or anything, for that matter. But if geekdom is your goal, don’t let anyone tell you it’s unattainable. You don’t have to be there “from the beginning” (whatever that means). You don’t have to start when you’re a kid. You don’t need to be a member of a particular <a href="https://eviltrout.com/2012/12/30/programming-since-i-was-seven.html">social class</a>, <a href="https://pgbovine.net/tech-privilege.htm">race</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_and_gender_distinction">sex</a>, or <a href="https://whatever.scalzi.com/2012/07/26/who-gets-to-be-a-geek-anyone-who-wants-to-be/">gender</a>.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Agreed.</p>

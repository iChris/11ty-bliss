<p>Jon Krakauer <a href="https://medium.com/@jonkrakauer/greg-mortenson-disgraced-author-of-three-cups-of-tea-believes-he-will-have-the-last-laugh-760949b1f964">gives an update on where Greg Mortenson, author of Three Cups of Tea, is these days</a> after being revealed to be a fraud and abuser of donations to his charity. Turns out, quite well actually:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Turning a blind eye to his dishonest words and deeds, the CAI board of directors has continued to pitch Mortenson as the organization’s moral exemplar and guiding light, and still pays him $176,000 per year, according to the latest financial records released by CAI.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Incredibly, Mortenson has attempted to build actual bridges to try and help connect his lies:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  And here’s the kicker: It was Mortenson who personally arranged for this bridge to be built and paid for with CAI funds, according to Zaman Ali, a resident of Askole who helped build it.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Unreal.</p>
<blockquote><p>
  When our heroes turn out to be sleazebags, self-deception is easier than facing the facts.

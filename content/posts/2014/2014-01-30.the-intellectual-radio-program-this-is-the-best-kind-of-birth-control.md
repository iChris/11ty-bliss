<blockquote><p>
  Justin Jackson sits in for an ill Adam Clark and we talk more GoodStuff stuff, Canadian stereotypes and other follow up. We spend the majority of the episode having a good discussion of different ways we shut off stresses of work when trying to enjoy home, friends and family. (Hint: Donâ€™t have kids!)
</p></blockquote>
<p>We took a <a href="https://twitter.com/jsatk/status/428381709780791296">tweet from Jesse Atkinson</a> and used it as the basis for our discussion. Fun to have the Canadian majority on TIRP for a change.</p>

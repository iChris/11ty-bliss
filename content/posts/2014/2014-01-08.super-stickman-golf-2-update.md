title: "Super Stickman Golf 2 Update"
---
<p>A <a href="https://www.noodlecake.com/presskits/ssg2update2/">big update to a great iOS game</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Turn based chat on each match.</li>
<li>Wagering on your match with the in-game dollars.</li>
<li>Customize your ball trails. (<em>It makes sense in the game. Trust me.</em>)</li>
<li>New courses - Super Meat Boy, Gears Land, Implausible Land and Space Land: a zero gravity course.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Trailer for Space Land Course</h3>

<h3>Now For Free</h3>
<p>In addition to all that, if you haven't picked it up yet - <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/ca/app/super-stickman-golf-2/id585259203?mt=8&amp;uo=4&amp;at=10l4Ki">go grab a copy right now while it's free</a>. I suspect that the Noodlecake crew is just suffering brain issues from the intense cold we're experiencing here in Saskatoon and will likely put the price back up to $2 when it warms up.</p>
<p>So really, you've got some time I think.</p>

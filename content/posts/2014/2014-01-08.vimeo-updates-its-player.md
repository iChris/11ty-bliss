title: "Vimeo Updates Its Player"

<p>Nice update to the Vimeo player - <a href="https://vimeo.com/blog/post:606">read more in their blog post</a> - but the two most important details to me are that its now responsive and supports closed captions/subtitles:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Just go to your video’s settings page, upload your caption file, and it will be available in the player. They’re supported in all desktop players, Mobile Safari on iOS 7, Chrome on Android tablets, and Kindle Fire, for now. We’re working hard to bring them to other platforms and devices as soon as we can.

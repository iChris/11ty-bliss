<p>Backblaze - <a href="https://www.backblaze.com/partner/af2307">sign up here and support my blog</a> - does automatic, offsite back up from your computer. I use it and love having a backup system that I don't have to think about - much like Apple's own Time Machine service that's built into every Mac - plus it's offsite.</p>
<p>Over on the Backblaze blog they've <a href="https://blog.backblaze.com/2014/03/19/backblaze-storage-pod-4/">written up details on their storage pod 4</a> - the system of hard drives they build to back up all their customer's data:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Storage Pod 4.0 uses forty-five 4 TB hard drives for a storage capacity of 180 TB
</p></blockquote>
<p>They've managed to get the cost per gigabyte down from $0.117 for their original Storage Pod in September, 2009 to $0.0517 currently on Storage Pod 4.</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://www.45drives.com/wiki/index.php/Main_Page">learn how to build your own</a> for around $10,500 or order it from <a href="https://www.45drives.com/">45drives</a> for $12,600.</p>
<p>We will never have enough storage.</p>

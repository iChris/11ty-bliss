<p>Found this band <a href="https://twitter.com/marcoarment/status/490321351631056896">via Marco Arment</a>. You may enjoy them as well if you like folksy songs with a touch of acoustic guitar magic.</p>
<p>Their first two albums are supposed to be available for free on <a href="https://www.themilkcartonkids.com">their website</a> but perhaps because of the Marco Arment tweet, their <a href="https://db.tt/czHe7sK">Dropbox</a> account is suspended due to too many downloads.</p>
<p>Their 3rd album, the Grammy nominated Ash &amp; Clay, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/ca/album/the-ash-clay/id586847819?uo=4&amp;at=10l4Ki">is available on iTunes</a>.</p>

title: "Postbot for WordPress Photo Blogs"
---
<p>Great new service from the folks behind WordPress called <a href="https://postbot.co">Postbot</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Postbot will create a post for each photo and schedule it to appear at a certain time over a given number of days. This is the ideal way to share a lot of photos without having to manually create and schedule each one.</p>
<p>  When everything is ready just pick a schedule — a start date and the number of days between each photo — and we’ll do the rest. If you want to exclude the weekends then that’s fine too.
</p></blockquote>
<p>In order to use Postbot on a self-hosted WordPress site, you'll need to have the <a href="https://jetpack.me/">Jetpack plugin</a> installed with the <a href="https://jetpack.me/support/json-api/">JSON API enabled</a>.</p>
<p>The obvious use for Postbot would be for a photography blog, but using it on a regular blog to interject photos could be a great way to keep the site fresh without having to manually post something as often.</p>

title: "Chris Enns on The Gently Mad"

<p>Hey that's me!</p>
<p>My <a href="https://goodstuff.fm/">Goodstuff</a> co-founder Adam Clark was nice enough to have me as a guest on his podcast, The Gently Mad:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Adam is joined by fellow podcaster and Goodstuff co-founder, Chris Enns. They discuss, of course, podcasting, how Chris came to be a blogger and podcaster, and his web business, Lemon Productions.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Adam does a great job of making his interviews less interview-y and more conversational. I had lots of fun being on the other side of the mic, so to speak.</p>

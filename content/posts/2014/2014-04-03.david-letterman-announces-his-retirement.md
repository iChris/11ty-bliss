<p>Happening sometime in 2015. Still my favourite all-around talk show host even if it's felt like he's been phoning it in at times in recent years.</p>
<p>I don't agree with Andy Inhatko's assessment of Jimmy Fallon, but his <a href="https://ihnatko.com/2014/03/28/my-1135-pm-tv-comedy-provider/">write up on who he prefers to watch in late night TV is spot on with regards to Letterman</a>. He wrote it a week ago but maybe he sensed (or knew?) something was happening:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  I concede that this kind of traditional desk-and-chair show is old-fashioned and I doubt that the concept will survive long after Dave chooses to retire. But night after night, Dave delivers the goods and proves why this time-worn format is a killer with the right person behind the desk.

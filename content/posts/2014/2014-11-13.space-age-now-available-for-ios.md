<blockquote><p>
  Space Age is a game of cosmic adventure. Set in the retro-futuristic sci-fi world of 1976, it follows a small but determined band of intergalactic explorers who land on a seemingly uninhabited planet, Kepler-16. They soon discover there’s something both strange and familiar about this alien place…

<p>This is one of the few times I get to actually say "I've been testing this for a few weeks now and it's great" because somehow I managed to get an invite on to the Space Age beta and play through it a bit - up until I upgraded my phone and was no longer a novelty user running an iPhone 4 AND partially colour blind. Plus it's set in the year I was born. So there's that.</p>
<p>I only played through the first two levels but can definitely say it's a blast to play. The storyline of the game is fun to get into and the nostalgic 90s style game play is lots of fun. <a href="https://twitter.com/mrgan">Neven Mrgan</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/mattcomi">Matt Comi</a>, the developers of the game under the company name Big Bucket Software, do such a great job of mining nostalgic elements while still keeping the game modern with gameplay elements, flow, style and user interface.</p>
<p>If you like this style of game, you should check out their previous game, The Incident (<a href="https://itunes.apple.com/ca/app/the-incident/id385533456?mt=8&uo=4&at=10l4Ki" target="itunes_store">iOS App Store</a>, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/ca/app/the-incident/id408679233?mt=12&uo=4&at=10l4Ki" target="itunes_store">Mac App Store</a>).</p>
<p>Pick up Space Age for only $3.99 <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/ca/app/space-age-a-cosmic-adventure/id922380267?mt=8&uo=4&at=10l4Ki" target="itunes_store">in the App Store</a>. Pairing your iOS device with an AppleTV and putting it up on the big screen via AirPlay would be a great way to play it.</p>
<p>They're apparently working on a Mac version of Space Age as well.</p>
<p>You can also pick up the soundtrack for the game in iTunes - <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/ca/album/space-age-original-game-soundtrack/id937519307?uo=4&at=10l4Ki" target="itunes_store">Space Age (Original Game Soundtrack) by Cabel Sasser</a> - if you need more 8bit tunes in your life.</p>

title: "Are You Slacking?"
---
<p>We've been loving using <a href="https://slack.com/r/024f4t6l-0252v8q9" target="_blank">Slack</a> to help us build <a href="https://goodstuff.fm">Goodstuff.fm</a>. The amount of email back and forth and instant messages it's saved both for the building of the website as well as arranging/scheduling/recording podcasts is incredible.</p>
<p>Adam Lisagor of Sandwich Video was a skeptic, like many are when introduced to the idea of using Slack at their business. When he came around he wanted to make a video to help share the Slack love.</p>
<p>Slack:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  We tried to get Adam and the Sandwich video team to make us a video. They didn't want to because "products like that never work". Six months later, they were using it. Seven months later they were in love. A month after that they were shooting this video â€¦

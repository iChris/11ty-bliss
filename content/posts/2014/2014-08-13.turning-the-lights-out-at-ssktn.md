title: "Turning the Lights Out at SSKTN"
---
<p>At least for the near future, SSKTN.com as a website will exist primarily to redirect old episodes of podcasts like <a href="https://goodstuff.fm/smym">Show Me Your Mic</a> to their new <a href="https://goodstuff.fm">Goodstuff.fm</a> home.</p>
<blockquote><p>
  I’d really like to thank all listeners, guests and fans of SSKTN who’ve supported me and the podcasting I do over the years. Without having you tuning in, downloading and listening each week it goes without saying that I would have given up on this little hobby a long time ago.
</p></blockquote>
<p>With all my podcasting efforts being poured into Goodstuff, it's fairly obvious that something had to give with SSKTN. I still like the domain name and want to use it for <em>something</em> at some point in the future.</p>
<p>But for now, it'll be a simple landing page and redirecting service.</p>

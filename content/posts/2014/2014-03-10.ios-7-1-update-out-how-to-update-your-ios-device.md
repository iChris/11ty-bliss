title: "iOS 7.1 Update Out - How to Update Your iOS Device"
---
<p>I decided to update my <a href="https://chrisenns.com/2011/11/how-to-upgrade-your-iphone-over-the-air-ota/">old iOS upgrade guide</a> with new iOS 7 based screenshots and with iOS 7.1 out (full details <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2014/03/10/apple-releases-ios-7-1/">on Macrumors.com</a>, <a href="https://www.macworld.com/article/2105988/ios-7-1-adds-carplay-interface-tweaks-accessibility-enhancements.html">Macworld.com</a> or <a href="https://www.apple.com/ios/ios7-update/">Apple.com</a>), now's as good a chance as any.</p>
<h3>Minimum Requirements</h3>
<p>First make sure your device meets the compatibility requirements Apple has specified for iOS 7. You can check <a href="https://www.apple.com/ca/ios/features/">Apple's website</a> or view the screenshot I've embedded below:</p>

<p>Unlike your computer where you might be able to run a new game or app on an older computer that doesn't meet the minimum system requirements and just deal with slower performance or graphics, Apple's iOS updates simply won't install on a device Apple hasn't approved.</p>
<h3>Find Settings.app</h3>
<p>It's the gear looking icon. If you can't remember where you put it, try swiping down to use Spotlight and start typing "settings":</p>

<h3>General</h3>
<p>Scroll down until you see <strong>General</strong></p>

<h3>Software Update</h3>
<p>Tap Software Update - which might have a 1 beside it indicating there's an update waiting. Otherwise tap through and it will check for an update.</p>

<h3>Checking for Update</h3>
<p>Your iOS device will ping Apple's software update servers to see if there's a new version.</p>

<h3>iOS 7.1 Download and Install</h3>
<p>Tap the <strong>Download and Install</strong> option to get this party started.</p>
<p><img src="https://chrisenns.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/tutorial-upgrade-ios-01-400x600.jpg" alt="tutorial-upgrade-ios-01" width="400" height="600" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-21873" /></p>
<h3>Terms &amp; Conditions</h3>
<p>Lawyer speak for "We're not responsible if this breaks your phone because, like, yo."</p>
<p><img src="https://chrisenns.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/tutorial-upgrade-ios-02-400x600.jpg" alt="tutorial-upgrade-ios-02" width="400" height="600" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-21874" /></p>
<h3>Downloads Ahoy</h3>
<p>It'll now begin downloading. Your download size will vary depending on what version of iOS you're upgrading from. In my case I had iOS 7.0? installed so it was a 152MB update.</p>
<p><img src="https://chrisenns.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/tutorial-upgrade-ios-03-400x600.jpg" alt="tutorial-upgrade-ios-03" width="400" height="600" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-21875" /></p>
<p>At this point you can switch away and use your iOS device for other stuff while it's updating. (I got a phone call during my update. Thanks Mastercard!) From my roots in the Microsoft Windows world I'm always sketchy about doing anything else while a software update is happening so your mileage may vary.</p>
<h3>Preparing Update</h3>
<p>After downloading it will prepare the update.</p>
<p><img src="https://chrisenns.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/tutorial-upgrade-ios-04-400x600.jpg" alt="tutorial-upgrade-ios-04" width="400" height="600" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-21876" /></p>
<p>...and then it will continue to prepare...</p>
<p><img src="https://chrisenns.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/tutorial-upgrade-ios-05-400x600.jpg" alt="tutorial-upgrade-ios-05" width="400" height="600" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-21877" /></p>
<h3>Install iOS 7.1 Update</h3>
<p>Confirm that what you've started you'd like to finish.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: Depending on your device and version of iOS that you're upgrading from, it can take a half hour to update. So if you have a meeting in 5 minutes, you may want to do it later.</p>
<p><img src="https://chrisenns.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/tutorial-upgrade-ios-04-400x600.png" alt="tutorial-upgrade-ios-04" width="400" height="600" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-21883" /></p>
<h3>Verifying the Update</h3>
<p>Wait! We need to verify that what we just downloaded is what we want to install. So wait!</p>
<p><img src="https://chrisenns.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/tutorial-upgrade-ios-05-400x600.png" alt="tutorial-upgrade-ios-05" width="400" height="600" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-21884" /></p>
<h3>Long White Bar of Upgrade Process</h3>
<p>Now you wait while your iOS device gets updated.</p>
<p><img src="https://chrisenns.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/tutorial-upgrade-ios-06-600x400.jpg" alt="tutorial-upgrade-ios-06" width="600" height="400" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-21885" /></p>
<h3>Boom, You're Done</h3>
<p>It took about 30 minutes for me start to finish. Your mileage may vary.</p>
<p><img src="https://chrisenns.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/tutorial-upgrade-ios-07-400x600.png" alt="tutorial-upgrade-ios-07" width="400" height="600" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-21886" /></p>
<p>If you navigate back to <strong>Settings.app</strong>, <strong>General</strong> and <strong>Software Update</strong> you should see that you're good to go with iOS 7.1.</p>
<p><img src="https://chrisenns.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/tutorial-upgrade-ios-08-400x600.png" alt="tutorial-upgrade-ios-08" width="400" height="600" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-21887" /></p>
<p>How does iOS 7.1 feel on your device? My initial impressions on my iPhone 4 is that it's snappier. We'll see after more extended use.</p>

title: "iPhone 6 Slow-mo Comparison"
---
<p>I shot video of my brother-in-law over the weekend with the iPhone 6's 240fps mode - also available on iPhone 5S' as well- and then wanted to quickly upload it to YouTube or Vimeo to share.</p>
<p>The problem is under iOS (iOS8 too), the share sheet upload option apparently compresses the footage more than using the native <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/ca/app/youtube-capture/id576941441?mt=8&uo=4&at=10l4Ki">YouTube Capture</a> or <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/ca/app/vimeo/id425194759?mt=8&uo=4&at=10l4Ki">Vimeo</a> apps for iOS. But if you just go grab the video clip in your Camera Roll and try uploading to YouTube it doesn't have the slow motion "effect" applied.</p>
<h3>My Workflow to Get Slow-mo Clips to the Web</h3>
<p>I started by putting the slow-mo clip into <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/ca/app/imovie/id377298193?mt=8&uo=4&at=10l4Ki">iMovie for iOS</a>, turning on the fade-in/fade-out options, choosing a theme which adds background music and then saved it back to the camera roll. Slow-mo settings still intact.</p>
<p>Then I used the aforementioned YouTube Capture and Vimeo apps to upload to each service.</p>
<p>Which service does a better job of compressing/presenting the video? (YouTube ads notwithstanding. I pay for a <a href="https://vimeo.com/plus" target="_blank">Vimeo Plus account</a> for <a href="https://lemonproductions.ca">client videos</a>.</p>

<p>Make sure the "HD" option is set.</p>
<p>Can you tell the difference?</p>

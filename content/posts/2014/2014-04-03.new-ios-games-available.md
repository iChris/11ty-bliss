title: "New iOS Games Available"
---
<p>There's been a couple of new games released for iOS this week that all the nerds are talking about. Or at least a lot of the nerds I follow on the internets.</p>
<h3>Monument Valley</h3>
<p>Beautiful design and smart gameplay with artwork inspired by M.C. Escher's work.</p>

<p>From <a href="https://www.macstories.net/reviews/monument-valley-review/">Macstories.net review</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Although it may not last for weeks or force you to think over individual stages for several consecutive hours, every chapter is enjoyable and delightfully realized. Monument Valley is an elegant and fun iOS game that offers a beautiful experience with no equal on iOS.

<p>Monument Valley is <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/ca/app/monument-valley/id728293409?mt=8&amp;uo=4&amp;at=10l4Ki">available on the App Store for $3.99</a></p>
<h3>HearthStone: Heroes of Warcraft</h3>
<p>Don't be turned off by all the orcs, wizards and whatnots in this game. It's a great card/battle game (think the old game of War with fancy clothes on) that you can now play on your iPad.</p>
<p>I've been playing it on the Mac - <a href="https://us.battle.net/account/download/?show=hearthstone&amp;style=hearthstone">available on the Mac or PC for free</a> - and it's fun and easy to get into but there's a lot of depth to the game if you've got the time (I don't) or know how (I also don't).</p>
